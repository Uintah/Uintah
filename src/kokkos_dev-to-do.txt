Fix failing kokkos_rt tests
- Dbg failures hanging on exit possibly linked to --enable-sci-malloc, properly handling MasterLock in src/Core/Malloc?

Update build system to add -fopenmp only when building for Kokkos::OpenMP
- Trunk no longer adds -fopenmp

Replace --enable-kokkos with --enable-kokkos-openmp and --enable-kokkos-cuda
- Currently limited to building and running with one back-end or the other

Update build_kokkos.sh to pull the latest Kokkos release and apply Brad's latest Kokkos patch

Remove code not needed to bring minimal support for running with Kokkos::Cuda into trunk
- e.g. work-in-progress OnDemandDataWarehouse changes, slim RMCRT implementations
- Code will be preserved in a separate branch

Cleanup loop statement options in LoopExecution.hpp
- e.g. parallel_for_cpu_only
- Revisit Brad's parallel_initialize implementation

Cleanup newly added headers
- Consolidate includes in src/include/sci_defs/kokkos_defs.h and/or src/Core/Parallel/KokkosTools.h?
- Remove UintahMemorySpaces.h

Cleanup and standardize newly added macros
- UINTAH_ENABLE_KOKKOS necessary?
- Replace use of UINTAH_ENABLE_KOKKOS with Kokkos-based KOKKOS_ENABLE_OPENMP and KOKKOS_ENABLE_CUDA macros?
- Keep HAVE_CUDA?

Standardize boiler plate code added for Kokkos throughout Arches tasks
- e.g. execution space and memory space template typenames
- ExecutionObject vs. ExObj

Replace mentions of partitions with task executors

Bulletproofing on the OMP_NESTED environment variable
- Warn when the value specified doesn't match support need for the command line arguments passed
