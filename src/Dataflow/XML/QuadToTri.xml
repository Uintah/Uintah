    <summary>Convert a QuadSurfField into a TriSurfField.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        Given a QuadSurfField (or anything that supports the same
interface) as input, produce a TriSurfField as output -- each Quad
element gets split into 2 Tris.  In order to produce consistent splits
across faces, we alternate between two different templates for how to
do the split.

      <p>Use QuadToTri to convert an ImageField or QuadSurfField into
a TriSurfField.  The TriSurfField is then displayed in comparison with
the original field for verification that it was properly
triangulated.</p>
