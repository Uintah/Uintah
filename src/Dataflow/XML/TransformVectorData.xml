    <summary>Perform a specified functional transform on all of the
  data in a vector field.</summary>
    <description>

	<p>Do a transformation to each data element in the
	vector field.  Three transforms are specified in the GUI,
	one for the x value of the vector, one for the y value, and
	one for the z value.  They are all computed separately and at
	the same time, such that the results of one are not dependent
	upon the results of the others.</p>

	<p>In addition to the functions, the vectors can be normalized
	before and/or after the function is computed.</p>

	<p>The functions are specified using SCIRun's simple function
	parser.  'x, y, and z' are the the scalar variables used to
	represent the vector data for each element.  There are a
	number of mathematical functions available for use.  They
	are:</p>

	<p>+: Add two numbers.  Example: 4+3 = 7</p>
	<p>-: Subtract one number from another.  Example: 4-3 = 1</p>
	<p>*: Multiply two numbers.  Example: 4*3 = 12</p>
        <p>/: Divide one number from another.  Example: 12/3 = 4</p>
	<p>sin: Sine of a number in radians.  Example: sin(x)</p>
	<p>cos: Cosine of a number in radians.  Example: cos(x)</p>
	<p>sqrt: Square root of a number.  Example: sqrt(4) = 2</p>
	<p>sqr: Square of a number.  Example: sqr(2) = 4, sqrt(sqr(x))
	= x</p>
	<p>ln: Natural logarithm of a number.  Example: ln(x)</p>
	<p>exp: e raised to the nth power. Example: exp(ln(x)) = x</p>
	<p>log: Log base 10 of a number.  Example: log(100) = 2</p>
	<p>abs: Absolute value of a number.  Example: abs(-3) = 3</p>
        <p>pow: One number raised to the power of another.  Example:
	pow(3, 2) = 9</p>
	<p>random: Return a uniform random number between 0 and 1.
	Example: random()</p>
