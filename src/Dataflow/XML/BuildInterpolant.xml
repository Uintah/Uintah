    <summary>
      Build an interpolant field -- a field that says how to project
      the data from one field onto the data of a second field.
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        This module builds an interpolant field which contains data
        about how to interpolate the data from the source field onto
        the geometry of the destination field.  The resulting
        interpolant field can then be used by the ApplyInterpolant
        module to interpolate the values from a field similar to the
        source field onto the destination field.
      </p>
      <p>
        The source field for BuildInterpolant and ApplyInterpolant
        must contain the same geometry and data locations.  However
        they do not have to contain the same data values or value
        types.  For instance, a TetVolField of doubles with data at the
        nodes can be passed into the Source port of BuildInterpolant,
        and a TetVolField of Vectors with data also at the nodes and with
        the same mesh can be passed into the source port of
        ApplyInterpolant.
      </p>
      <p>
        DirectInterpolate should be used instead of BuildInterpolant
        and ApplyInterpolant if the Interpolant is not to be reused,
        as it does the same interpolation without building the
        intermediate interpolant field.  This should be used if the
        source field changes much more often than the destination field.
