    <summary>
      Build a mapping matrix -- a matrix that says how to project the
data from one field onto the data of a second field.
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        This module builds a mapping matrix which contains information
about how to interpolate the data from the source field onto the
geometry of the destination field.  The resulting mapping matrix can
then be used by the <modref package="SCIRun"
name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/> module to map the values from a field
similar to the source field onto the destination field.
      </p>
      <p>
        The source field for BuildMappingMatrix and <modref
package="SCIRun" name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/> must contain the same
geometry and data locations.  However they do not have to contain the
same data values or value types.  For instance, a TetVolField of
doubles with data at the nodes can be passed into the Source port of
BuildMappingMatrix, and a TetVolField of Vectors with data also at the
nodes and with the same mesh can be passed into the source port of
<modref package="SCIRun" name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <modref package="SCIRun" name="DirectMapping"/> should be used
instead of BuildMappingMatrix and <modref package="SCIRun"
name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/> if the mapping is not to be reused, as it
does the same interpolation without building the intermediate mapping
matrix.  This should be used if the source field changes much more
often than the destination field.

      <p>Build an interpolant from an input field onto a plane using
BuildMappingMatrix, and then apply the data from the input field back
to the interpolant field.</p>

      <p>Note that the same thing could be done by replacing both
BuildMappingMatrix and <modref package="SCIRun"
name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/> with a <modref package="SCIRun"
name="DirectMapping"/> module. ApplyMappingMatrix was meant primarily
to be used in conjunction with loops and time dependent data, such
that the interpolant field could be computed once and then applied
multiple times.</p>

      <p>See also <modref package="SCIRun"
name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/>, <modref package="SCIRun"
name="DirectMappingMatrix"/>, <modref package="SCIRun"
name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/>.</p>
