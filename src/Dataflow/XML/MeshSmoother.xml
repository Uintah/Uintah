    <summary>Nodal movement to improve mesh quality.</summary>
    <description>

      <p>The MeshSmoother module is used to move various nodes in a
mesh in an attempt to improve the overall mesh quality.  The TSTT
MESQUITE library is the work-horse for this module.
(see http://www.cs.sandia.gov/optimization/knupp/Mesquite.html and/or http://www.tstt-scidac.org/research/mesquite.html for more information,
or http://software.sandia.gov to download the MESQUITE library.)</p>

      <p> Only TetVol, HexVol, TriSurf, and QuadSurf meshes are currently 
supported by this module.  It is important that the triangles are oriented
consistently when smoothing a TriSurfMesh.</p>
