    <summary>Select a subset of a field.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        This module clips out a subset of a field.  The new field
        contains just the selected portion of the input field.
      </p>
      <p>

        The module runs in one of two different modes.  If a field
	is connected to the "Clip Field" port, the module will clip
	the input field such that only those elements inside of the
	clip field are preserved.  If no Clip Field is connected 
	then the GUI widget is used to select which portion of the
	input field to preserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The type of the field is preserved in the clip, as well as the
        data values if possible.  Some field types are structured and
        thus not clippable.  This includes the LatVolField, ImageField,
        and Scanline field types.  There is an <modref package="SCIRun" name="Unstructure"/> module that
        can be used to convert these fields to appropriately
        unstructured versions before clipping.
      </p>
      <p>
	Functional clipping has been deprecated from this module.  Use
	the new and much faster <modref package="SCIRun" name="ClipByFunction"/> module if that is needed.

<p>The ClipField module is used to extract a spherical input mesh from
it's bounding <modref package="SCIRun" name="SampleLattice"/>.  The
remaining cubes are the elements that the bounding box covers but that
do not actually fall inside of the input field.</p>

<p>In this network the ClipField module widget is used to select a chunk
of the input field for extraction.  Further editing could be done by
hand.</p>
