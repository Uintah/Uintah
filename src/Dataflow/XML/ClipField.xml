    <summary>Select a subset of a field.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        This module clips out a subset of a field.  The new field
        contains just the selected portion of the input field.  The
        module runs in two modes.  If the "clip field" is connected,
        it will clip the input field such that only those elements
        inside of the clip field are preserved.  If no clip field is
        connected, the GUI widget is used to select which portion of
        the input field to preserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The type of the field is preserved in the clip, as well as the
        data values if possible.  Some field types are structured and
        thus not clippable.  This includes the LatticeVol, ImageField,
        and Scanline field types.  There is an Unstructure module that
        can be used to convert these fields to appropriately
        unstructured versions before clipping.
