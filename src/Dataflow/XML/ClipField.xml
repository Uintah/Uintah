    <summary>Select a subset of a field.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        The ClipField module clips out a subset of a field.  It does
so by preserving all of the elements in the input field that match the
clipping criteria.  By default this is every element who's center is
within the clipping widget or clipping field.  As a side effect of
this algorithm any degenerate non-element items in the input field are
discarded by the clip.
      </p>
      <p>
        The module runs in one of two different modes.  If a field is
connected to the "Clip Field" port, the module will clip the input
field such that only those elements inside of the clip field are
preserved.  If no Clip Field is connected then the GUI widget is used
to select which portion of the input field to preserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The type of the field is preserved in the clip, as well as the
data values if possible.  Some field types are structured and thus not
clippable.  This includes the LatVolField, ImageField, and Scanline
field types.  There is an <modref package="SCIRun"
name="Unstructure"/> module that can be used to convert these fields
to appropriately unstructured versions before clipping.
      </p>
      <p>
	Functional clipping has been deprecated from this module.  Use
the new and much faster <modref package="SCIRun"
name="ClipByFunction"/> module if that is needed.

      <p>The ClipField module is used to extract a spherical input
mesh from it's bounding <modref package="SCIRun"
name="SampleLattice"/>.  The remaining cubes are the elements that the
bounding box covers but that do not actually fall inside of the input
field.</p>
