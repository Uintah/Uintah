      <p>
	Convert a LatVolField into a MaskedLatVolField and apply the
        given function to mask it out.  This is similar to the
        behavior of the ClipByFunction module, except that the input field
        is masked rather than clipped out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The function should be a valid C++ expression.  It will be
	dynamically compiled into a function of the form "bool
        inside_p(double x, double y, double z, TYPE v) { return EXPR; }"
        where TYPE is the data type contained in the field, and EXPR is the
        function typed into the GUI.
