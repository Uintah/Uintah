    <summary>Make a new field with data at elements instead of nodes.</summary>
    <description>

      <p>MoveNodeToElem creates a new field with the data at the
      mesh elements rather than at the nodes.   This currently only
      works on LatVolField and ImageField field types.  The data must
      be at the nodes.  A new field is created such that the data
      remains at the same positions in space but occupy the
      cell/face centers of the new mesh rather than being located at
      the node locations.  This is the opposite of <modref package="SCIRun" name="MoveElemToNode"/>.</p>

<title>MoveNodeToElem-img Regression Test</title>

<p>Test the MoveNodeToElem module by moving the data in an ImageField
from the nodes onto the faces while retaining the same data locations.
The ImageField is transformed first so that the positions are better tested.</p>
