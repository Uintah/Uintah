    <summary>Make a new field with data at elements instead of
nodes.</summary>
    <description>

      <p>MoveNodeToElem creates a new field with the data at the mesh
elements rather than at the nodes.   This currently only works on
LatVolField and ImageField field types.  The data must be at the
nodes.  A new field is created such that the data remains at the same
positions in space but occupy the cell/face centers of the new mesh
rather than being located at the node locations.  This is the opposite
of <modref package="SCIRun" name="MoveElemToNode"/>.</p>

      <p>Test the MoveNodeToElem module by moving the data in an
ImageField from the nodes onto the faces while retaining the same data
locations. The ImageField is transformed first so that the positions
are better tested.</p>
