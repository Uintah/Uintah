      <p>
The StreamLines module visualizes vector fields by
generating curves that interpolate the flow of vectors in a Field.
      </p>

<p> The Flow Field input port is the vector field on which the path
intergration of the seed points will be performed.  This may be a
vector field with any volume geometry type.  Surfaces and lower order
fields do not currently work due to numerical error.  The second input
port, Seeds, contains the initial values for which the flow will be
computed.  This may be a field of any type, as just the node positions
are used.  Seeds which are not contained within the flow field are
just discarded.  The module requires use of both field inputs in order
to execute.</p>

<p> The StreamLines module has one output, Streamlines, a CurveMesh,
representing a collection of stream lines computed for the Flow field
given the set of initial seed points.</p>

<p> This module uses one of several similar numeric integration
methods.  They are taken directly from Numerical Analysis by David
Kincaid and Ward Cheney, c1991.  Adams-Bashforth is a Multi-Step
method that offers the fastest performance by reusing existing samples
when possible.  It presents some interesting artifacts on
discontinuous models such that it is easy to visualize where those
discontinuities take place.  Heun is a second order Runge-Kutta
solver, and is sufficient for most smoothly varying fields, such as
linearly interpolated gradient fields over volume elements.  Classic
4th Order Runge-Kutta is presented for reference and provides
excellent results in general.  Adaptive Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg is a 5/6
order solver which provides the best overall results at the cost of
more computation time.  It is also the only adaptive method, meaning
the step size of the algorithm is adjusted dynamically as the stream
moves through the flow field. </p>


<p> All of the computation methods are similar in that they take a
step, (based upon the Step Size indicated) examine the derivative at
that point, and then procede in that new direction.  Adaptive
Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg also determines if a stepsize correction is
necessary. This determination is based upon the Error Tolerance
value. </p>

<p> The StreamLines GUI includes text fields for Error Tolerance, Step
Size, and Maximum Steps. The Error Tolerance text field represents the
margin of error when doing an adaptive calculation of the stream
lines.  Maximum Steps represents the maximum number of iterations.
</p>

<p>The user can specify whether streamlines are computed in negative
and/or, positive directions by changing the Direction radio
buttons. The Color Style options are based on either the seed number,
integration step, distance from the seed, or the total distance, which
will affect how values are attached to the output field.  By selecting
seed number, the output field will range from zero to the number of
seed points so that every stream line has exactly one value. The
integration step option changes the value of output field such that
they start at zero where the seed point is at and go up by one for
each integration step away in either direction. The distance from seed
is similar to the integration step but based on the cord length
distance from the seed. Whereas the total length is based on the total
cord length from the seed point.</p>

<p> The Filter Colinear Points check box is a postprocess on the
streams.  It passes over the streams and removes all points that are
too close together, as well as points that are colinear.  It is useful
for rendering the streamlines as it greatly simplifies them while
retaining their visual appearance.</p>

            Flow field is the field to be visualized.  It can be 
     	    2D or 3D and can be structured or unstructured.
	    StreamLines is more effective if Flow field represents the
	    flow present in a field rather than the gradient of a generic
	    field.

        The GUI for StreamLines allows the user to control the 
        parameters for the advection algorithm (Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg)
        used to extract the streamlines.

<title>StreamLines-cellwalk Regression Test</title>

<p>Test the StreamLine cellwalk code by making a synthetic cell centered
lattice vortex data set and then computing a set of streamlines
through that data set.</p>

<p>This network can be found at src/nets/Modules/Visualization/StreamLines-cellwalk.net.</p>

<title>StreamLines-lic Regression Test</title>

<p>Use the StreamLines module to create a line interval convolution like
visualization of a vector data set.  First the scalar voltages for the
utahtorso-lowres model are loaded in and then the gradient is taken of
that data set.  Then 1000 seeds are randomly picked from inside the
torso.  These are then streamlined and colored according to which seed
they are.  Since the seeds are randomly distributed this results in
a random but unique color per streamline.  Finally all of the 1000
streamlines are displayed as transparent lines along with a reference
torso boundary and the heart model.  For full 3D effect the model should
be rotated interactively.</p>
