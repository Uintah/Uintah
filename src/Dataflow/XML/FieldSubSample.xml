The Field Sub Sample module sub samples a structured grid. It is
posible to sub sample a particular region or sparsely sample the grid.
      </p>

      <p> The Field Sub Sample input port is a field that is
structured in 3D. This field will be sub sampled in 3D and piped to
the output port. The user can sub-sample the grid in all directions
via the GUI. The sub-sampling can be performed either of two ways, a
sub region can be selected or values can be skipped. A combination of
both is also possible. </p> 

      <p> The "Start Node" defines the first sampling. Because the
data is circular in the Theta and Phi directions the ending node is
defined as the "Start Node" plus the "Number of Nodes". This allows
for overlap in the data. In the case of the Radial direction the
number of nodes is limited based on the size of the data. The "Skip
Nodes" defines how often the data will be sample between start and end
nodes. </p>

      <p>Read in the utah torso model and display it's boundary for
reference. Then resample the model using the SampleLattice module to
fit it to a regular grid which is then visualized as a point cloud.
Finally the FieldSubSample module is used to select a sublattice from
the sampled lattice.  This sublattice is then drawn using larger dots
and compared with the underlying mesh to determine that it was
selected correctly.</p>
