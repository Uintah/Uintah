    <summary>Probe values in a field.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        A GUI Point widget is created and can be moved around in the
scene.  The Probe Point port contains a PointCloudField field with one
point in it at the location of the probe.  The value at that point is
interpolated from the input field.  The input field is also used to
determine the initial position and relative size of the probe widget.
If there is no input field, a default zero valued probe is returned.
      </p>
      <p>
	The Element Index matrix contains the Index of the item with
data that is nearest the cell.  A possible use would be to feed the
index into <modref package="SCIRun" name="MatrixSelectVector"/> to get
out a time-dependent sequence associated with that element.  No matrix
is sent if there is not an input field.
