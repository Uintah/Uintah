        Generates a clock for rendering animations.
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p>This module adds a clock to the view. It is most useful when
rendering animations. It has a single input which is matrix containing
one value, the time. The output is geometry. </p>
      <p>The clock type may be either a digital or analog. When
creating an analog clock it is possible to also display the time
digitally.</p> 
      <p>The clock style sets the border and color. If the time is
displayed digitally the format can be set using a C style format.</p> 
      <p>The clock range sets beginning and end time for an analog
clock.</p> 
      <p>The clock size sets size.</p> 
      <p>The clock location set the location to be in one of the
viewer corners.</p>
