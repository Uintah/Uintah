    <summary>The Viewer displays interactive graphical output to the
    computer screen. Use the Viewer to see a geometry, or spatial
    data. The Viewer provides access to many simulation parameters
    and controls, thus, indirectly initiates new iterations of the
    simulation steps important to computational steering.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>Autoview restores the display back to a default
      condition. This is very useful when objects disappear from the 
      view window due to a combination of settings. 
      </p>
      <p>Set Home View captures the setting of the current view so you
      can return to it later by clicking the "Go
      home" button.
      </p>
      <p>Go home restores the current home view.
      </p>
      <p>Views lists a number of standard viewing angles and
      orientations. The view directions align with the Cartesian 
      axes of the objects. The ``Up vector'' choice sets the 
      orientation of the objects when viewed along the selected axis.
      </p> 
      <p>From the Viewer window, the left corner of the control panel 
      contains performance indicators that document the current 
      rendering speed for the display. More advanced graphics
      performance results in a higher drawing rate.
      </p>
      <p> A small plus sign (``+'') appears in the lower right corner 
      of the Viewer window. Clicking on the plus sign reveals the 
      extended control panel.
      </p>
