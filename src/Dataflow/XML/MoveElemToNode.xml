    <summary>Make a new field with data at nodes instead of elements.</summary>
    <description>

      <p>MoveElemToNode creates a new field with the data at the mesh
      nodes rather than at the elements.  This currently only works on
      LatVolField and ImageField field types.  The data must be at
      cells/faces as appropriate to the field type.  A new field is
      created such that the data remains at the same positions in
      space but occupy the nodes of the new mesh rather than being
      located at the cell/face locations.  This is the opposite of
      MoveNodeToElem.</p>
