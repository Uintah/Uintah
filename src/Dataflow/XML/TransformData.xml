    <summary>Perform a specified functional transform on all of the
  data in a field.</summary>
    <description>
    	<p>Compute the specified function on each data element in the
	 input field.</p>

        <p>The data transform is specified in the GUI as the body of a
	C++ function.  The input values to the function are x, y, z,
	and v, where x, y, and z are the positions of the data point
	and v is the value of the input field's data element.  No
	value is returned, rather set the 'result' variable to the
	return type.  For example, "result = x + v;" would return a
	new field containing the x position of each element added with
	the value that was already there. "result = v.x();" could be
	used to extract the x component of a vector field into a
	scalar field.</p>

<title>TransformData-scalarsphere Regression Test</title>

<p>Use the TransformData module to set the values in a LatVolField to be
the distance function, then use ShowField and transparency in the
<modref package="SCIRun" name="GenStandardColorMaps"/> module to display a sphere within that lattice.</p>

<p>This network can be found at src/nets/Modules/FieldsData/TransformData-scalarsphere.net.</p>

<title>TransformData-vectorvortex Regression Test</title>

<p>Use the TransformData module to create a cylcone data set by
resampling a LatVolField onto a PointCloudField, then setting each
point to be a vector of position crossed with the up vector.  This
dataset is then viewed using the <modref package="SCIRun" name="ShowField"/> module.</p>
