    <summary>Select a subset of a field.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        The ClipByFunction module clips out a subset of a field.  It does so by
        preserving all of the elements in the input field for which
        the user specified C++ expression evaluates to true at the specified
        test location.  As a side effect of this algorithm any
        degenerate non-element items in the input field are discarded
        by the clip.
      </p>
      <p>
        The type of the field is preserved in the clip, as well as the
        data values if possible.  Some field types are structured and
        thus not clippable.  This includes the LatVolField, ImageField,
        and Scanline field types.  There is an <modref package="SCIRun" name="Unstructure"/> module that
        can be used to convert these fields to appropriately
        unstructured versions before clipping.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user function should be a valid C++ expression.  It will be
	dynamically compiled into a function of the form "bool
        inside_p(double x, double y, double z, TYPE v) { return EXPR; }"
        where TYPE is the data type contained in the field, and EXPR is the
        function typed into the GUI.
      </p>
      <p>
        The geometric location of the test is be specified in addition to
        the function.  The test can be valid if it works at element
        centers, at one node, or at all of the nodes in each mesh
        element.  If the data location of the clip is different that
        the location of the data in the field, 'v' will always be 0
        for that test (because there is no data there).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, "x gt 0" would clip the field to only those
	elements with positions greater than 0.  "y lt 3 || z gt 2.5" would
	preserve just the elements with y position less than 3 or z
	position greater than 2.5.  "v == 4" would preserve all of the
	elements that contained a data value of 4.  *Note that current
	simple HTML parser cannot handle greater than or less than
        symbols, abbreviated them to 'gt' and 'lt'.

<net id="ClipByFunction-byvalue">
<title>ClipByFunction-byvalue Regression Test</title>

<p>This network demonstrates using the ClipByFunction module to extract
the lungs from the torso model.  The lungs are already classified in
the torso model and have a particular conductivity table entry of 4,
so we can extract all of the elements from the torso with conductivity
of 4 and just get the lungs.</p>

<p>Note that alternatively we could use 'v != 4' to get a model with the
lungs removed.  Or we could use the different values in the field to
single out the ribs, heart, and others that were already classified.</p>

<title>ClipByFunction-positional Regression Test</title>

<p>This demonstrates using ClipByFunction to chop out a wedge from a
field so that we can more easily view the interior.  The original
field is draw in a transparent wireframe for reference.</p>
