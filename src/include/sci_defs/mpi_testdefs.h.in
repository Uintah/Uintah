// On Mira, for many of their MPI functions they have turned off the 'const' for some parameters.
// They do this by having the following commented out in their mpi.h: /* #define MPICH2_CONST const */
// In order to compile on Mira, we must match their spec, so we have to turn off the const.
// The following define does that:

@DEF_MPI_CONST_WORKS@

@DEF_MPI_MAX_THREADS@
@DEF_MPI3_ENABLED@
