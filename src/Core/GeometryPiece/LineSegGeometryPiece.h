CLASS
   LineSegGeometryPiece

   Creates geometry based on a sequential set of x-y points.

GENERAL INFORMATION

   LineSegGeometryPiece.h

KEYWORDS
   LineSegGeometryPiece BoundingBox inside

DESCRIPTION
   Fill geometry described by a file containing a sequential set of x-y points.
   This obviously only works for 2-D and assumes that the points are in the
   x-y plane (z=0).
   Requires one input: file name containing the points
   There are methods for checking if a point is inside the surface
   and also for determining the bounding box for the surface.
   The input form looks like this:
       <line_segment>
         <file>surface.pts</file>
       </line_segment>
