// This class is crucial for Uintah portability.  It contains
// additional task parameters to help aid execution of this task on
// different architectures.  At the time of this file's creation a
// Detailed Task supporting portabiltiy consisted of the following:
//                        const PatchSubset* patches,
//                        const MaterialSubset* matls,
//                        DataWarehouse* fromDW,
//                        DataWarehouse* toDW,
//                        UintahParams & uintahParams,
//                        ExecutionObject & execObj
// For GPU related tasks in particular, this object wraps a Kokkos
// instance.  Further, this task wraps the command line execution
// arguments given so that a particular task can modify these
// arguments further.  From the application developer's perpsective,
// the execObj received should be passed into a Uintah parallel loop
// from LoopExecution.hpp.  The application developer does not need to
// modify this object at all, and likely most of the time won't need
// to.
