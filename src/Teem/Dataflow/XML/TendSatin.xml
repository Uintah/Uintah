      <p>Generate a pretty synthetic DT volume. The surface of a
sphere or torus is covered with either linear or planar anisotropic
tensors, or somewhere in between.</p>
      <p>Generate Torus Dataset : generate a torus dataset if checked,
otherwise generate a sphere dataset.</p>
      <p>Anisotropy Parameter : anisotropy parameter. 0.0 for one
direction of linear (along the equator for spheres, or along the
larger circumference for toruses), 1.0 for planar, 2.0 for the other
direction of linear (from pole to pole for spheres, or along the
smaller circumference for toruses) (float)</p>
      <p>Max Anisotropy : maximum anisotropy in dataset, according to
the ca1 anisotropy metric. A value of 1.0 means completely linear or
completely planar anisotropy (float)</p>
      <p>Min Anisotropy : minimum anisotropy in the dataset
(float).</p>
      <p>Boundary : parameter governing how fuzzy the boundary between
high and low anisotropy is. Use 0.0 for no fuzziness (float)</p>
      <p>Thickness : parameter governing how thick region of high
anisotropy is (float)</p>
      <p>Size : dimensions of output volume. For size N, the output is
N x N x N for spheres, and 2N x 2N x N for toruses (int)</p>
