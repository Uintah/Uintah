    <p>Calculate structure tensors from a scalar field. Not a diffusion
tensor, but it is symmetric and positive-definate.</p>
    <p>Difference Scale : the radius of the kernel used for differentiation
    to computer gradient vectors (in pixels).  This number should be an 
    integer.</p>
    <p>Integration Scale : the radius of the kernel used for blurring 
    outer products of gradients in order compute structure tensors (in pixels).
    This number should be an integer.</p>
    <p> Downsample Factor : the factor by which to downsample when creating
    volume of structure tensors.  This should also be an integer.</p>
