    <summary>Estimate tensors from a set of DW images. </summary>
    <description>
      <p>Estimate tensors from a set of DW images. The various DWI
volumes must be stacked along axis 0 (as with the output of "tend
epireg"). The tensor coefficient weightings associated with each of
the DWIs, the B-matrix, is given as a seperate array, see "tend bmat"
usage info for details. A "confidence" value is computed with the
tensor, based on a soft thresholding of the sum of all the DWIs,
according to the threshold and softness parameters.</p>
      <p>B0 is stored as first DWI value : Determines if the B=0
non-diffusion-weighted reference image is known, or if it has to be
estimated along with the tensor elements. Check it if true to indicate
that the B=0 image is the FIRST input image given , and hence the
B-matrix has ONE LESS row than the number of of input images. If
false, there is no reference image; all the input images are
diffusion-weighted in some way or another, and there exactly as many
rows in the B-matrix as there are input images</p>
      <p>Threshold : </p>
      <p>Soft : how fuzzy the confidence boundary should be. By
default, confidence boundary is perfectly sharp. This value should be
a float.</p>
      <p>Scale : After estimating the tensor, scale all of its
elements (but not the confidence value) by this amount. Can help with
downstream numerical precision if values are very large or small. This
value should be a float.</p>
