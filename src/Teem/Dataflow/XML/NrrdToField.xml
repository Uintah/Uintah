    <summary>Convert a combination of Nrrds to a SCIRun Field. This
converter works on regular, unstructured and structured Data. If the
module receives just Data, it will most likely be a regular Field
(i.e. ScanLine, Image, LatVol).  For structured and unstructured
Fields, the data is optional. If Points but no Connections are given,
a structured dataset will most likely be created (i.e. StructQuad,
StructHex).  If Points and Connections are given, an unstructured
field will most likely be created (i.e. Curve, TriSurf, QuadSurf,
TetVol, HexVol). If a Field is passed in, the module will try to use
that Field's mesh.

      <p>Convert a combination of Nrrds to a SCIRun Field. This
converter works on regular, unstructured and structured Data. If the
module receives just Data, it will most likely be a regular Field
(i.e. ScanLine, Image, LatVol).  For structured and unstructured
Fields, the data is optional. If Points but no Connections are given,
a structured dataset will most likely be created (i.e. StructQuad,
StructHex).  If Points and Connections are given, an unstructured
field will most likely be created (i.e. Curve, TriSurf, QuadSurf,
TetVol, HexVol). If a Field is passed in, the module will try to use
that Field's mesh.</p>
      <p>The first port is for Points.</p>
      <p>The second port should contain a Nrrd of connectivity.  This
should be in the form P x N where P is the points in a connection and
N is the number of connections.  For example, a TriSurf would have a
connections nrrd that would be 3 x N.  The Unstructured Field will be
determined based on the size of P.  A size of two will convert to a
CurveMesh, a size of three will be a TriSurf, etc. In the case of P
being equal to size 4, there is an ambiguity whether or not the
resulting Field should be a TetVolField or QuadSurfField.  This can be
indicated in the NrrdToField UI under the option Unstructured Cell
Type when Points per Connection = 4. If Auto is selected, then the
module will try to determine the Cell Type based on the Nrrd's
Properties.  If it cannot be determined, a Cell Type of TetVolField.
If the Points Nrrd happens to be in the form of N x P, the module will
try to determine that and handle it accordingly.</p>
      <p>The third port is the Data port.  For the case of Regular
data, this should be the only port connected. If it contains vector or
tensor data values, they should be in the first axis and it's kind
should be set accordingly.  This can be done with the <modref
package="Teem" name="UnuAxinfo"/> module.</p>
      <p>The last port is the an optional Field input.  If this is
connected, the module will attempt to use the Mesh from this Field for
the new Field. If the input Field's Mesh does not match the
information given in the other ports, it will default to the behavior
above an disregard the incoming Field.</p>
      <p>The UI option Permute Data will permute Fortran data or data
in the form (k,j,i).</p>
      <p>The UI option Build Eigen Decomposition for Tensor Field"
will build the decomposition using a call to the Teem library
(tenEigenSolve_f).</p>
      <p>The UI option of Structured/Unstructured Ambiguity is when
the Data, or Points has a size of one in the first dimension.  This
could be a Point Cloud or Struct Curve. If Auto is selected, the
module will try to determine based on the Nrrd Property's Cell Type.
If it cannot be determined, the module will create a Point Cloud.  The
UI settings will always over-ride the NrrdProperties.</p>
      <p>The list of Nrrd Names at the bottom of the UI is for
information only.</p>
