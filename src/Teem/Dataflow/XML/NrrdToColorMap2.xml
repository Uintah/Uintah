    <summary>Load an Image and output it as a ColorMap2</summary>
    <description>
      <p>The input nrrd must be and rgba image that is 512 x 256, so a
3 dimensional nrrd that is 4 x 512 x 256</p>
      <p>Typically this is used to create a precise image to texture
your volume vis with.  The inputs to EditTransferFunc2 take a
ColorMap2 and a nrrd. That nrrd is a 2d histogram, which can be saved
and converted to an image readable by 3rd party painting programs. You
can then paint the areas of the image as you wish, and convert it back
to a nrrd, then feed it to this module to send downstream as a
ColorMap2.</p>
