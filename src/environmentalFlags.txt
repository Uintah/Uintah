This file contains a partial list of the environmental variables that a user can set.

Set these like this:
 -> tcsh: setenv SCI_DEBUG ExecTimes:+
 -> bash: export SCI_DEBUG=ExecTimes:+
To set multiple flags, use quotation marks and separate flags by a comma:
(no spaces after commas)
 -> bash: export SCI_DEBUG="ExecTimes:+,TaskGraph:+,WASATCH_FIELDS:+"�
 -> tcsh: setenv SCI_DEBUG  ExecTimes:+,TaskGraph:+,WASATCH_FIELDS:+

                                       NOTE: Reported values are:
                                                1) Represented in seconds
                                                2) Cumulative over 10 timesteps
                                               3a) Cumulative over nthreads when using the UnifiedScheduler
                                               3b) Cumulative over nthreads-1 when using the ThreadedMPIScheduler
                                       To view the top 10 tasks use:
                                       sort -t: -k 2 -k 3 -g -r exectimes.?.? | head
                                       To get a summary of all exectimes files run the script src/scripts/execsummary
