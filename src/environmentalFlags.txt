ExecTimes         SCI_DEBUG     Outputs the time for execution on each task
                                NOTE: TaskExecTimes are: 
                                        1) Represented in seconds
                                        2) Cumulative over 10*floor(MaxTimeSteps/10) timesteps
                                        3) Cumulative over the number for worker threads for multi-threaded runs
                                To view the top 10 tasks use:
                                sort -t: -k 2 -k 3 -g -r exectimes.?.? | head
                                To get a summary of all exectimes files run the script src/scripts/execsummary
                                NOTE: This only works with MPI and you must run your input file for more than 10 timesteps

Schedulers:                              NOTE: The default is "UnifiedScheduler"
__________________________________
SingleProcessor            SCI_DEBUG     Use SingleProcessorScheduler
MPI                        SCI_DEBUG     Use MPIScheduler - tasks are statically ordered

                                and "device-->host" data movement.
