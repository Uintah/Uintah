Resampling the Original Data Files
==================================

Original data is in ../OriginalAucklandHEART.dat
That data was split into position (.pts) and orientation (.f1, .f2) files
	using ../splitData.csh
The .pts, .f1, and .f2 files were resampled to produce smaller versions
	using SCIRun/src/Packages/DaveW/StandAlone/convert/SubsetPts
We're using 10% (randomly chosen) of the original data for these
	simulations -- thus the names 0.1.*
Our starting points file (0.1.pts) was tetrahedralized using a standard
	unconstrained Delauny mesh generation algorithm, resulting in the
	file 0.1.tet
From these 4 starting files: 0.1.{pts,tet,f1,f2} we will be generating
	new files -- those that are SCIRun data formats will be stored in
	the sr-data/ directory, and those that are CardioWave data
	will be stored in the cw-data/ directory.




Running SCIRun and CardioWave
=============================

NOTE: I will refer to the place where the data files are being stored as
        $DUKEDATA -- on the SCI machines, this is ~dmw/mydata/duke/mesh/
	and the root of SCIRun as $SCIRUN -- I'm using ~dmw/SCIRun/

We start by building SCIRun matrices from the .f1 and .f2 files --
	we do this with the StandAlone/convert/RawToColumnMatrix
	program -- this results in 0.1.f1.mat and 0.1.f2.mat
   % cd $DUKEDATA
   % $SCIRUN/src/StandAlone/convert/RawToDenseMatrix \
     0.1.f1 sr-data/0.1.f1.mat
   % $SCIRUN/src/StandAlone/convert/RawToDenseMatrix \
     0.1.f2 sr-data/0.1.f2.mat

Then we build a SCIRun TetVol<Vector> Field using
	StandAlone/convert/RawToTetVol -- this results in 0.1.tvv.fld
   % $SCIRUN/src/StandAlone/convert/RawToTetVol 0.1.pts 0.1.tet \
     sr-data/0.1.tvv.fld

Now we need to rescale the tet mesh to have sensical dimenions, and to
        remove the tet elements that weren't supposed to be there
        in the first place, i.e. the ones that are inside the convex
        hull of the heart surface, but that are far away from sample
        points.  We do that with cw1:rescale-and-remove-interior-tets.net
   % cd $SCIRUN/src/Packages/CardioWave/nets
   % ../../../scirun cw1:rescale-and-remove-interior-tets.net
	In this net, the "threshold" parameter controls how many tets
        are removed.  Algorithmically, it says if the centroid of the
        tet is further than this distance from any of its nodes,
        remove it.

Now we can run the first SCIRun visualization net
        (cw2:show-original-fibers.net) to visualize the original fiber
        orientations of the resampled data...
   % ../../../scirun cw2:show-original-fibers.net

We are now ready to construct a HexMesh and to run Vulcan to generate
        the CardioWave input files (SPR and VOLUME).  We use the
        SCIRun net - cw3:build-hex-mesh-and-fv-files.net for this.
   % ../../../scirun cw3:build-hex-mesh-and-fv-files.net
	The UI's for the CastTVtoMLV modules control the number of
        regularly spaced samples in the x/y/z directions -- note:
        these numbers must be changed in BOTH CastTVtoMLV UI's to be
        kept consistent.  This net also allows the user to select cell
        type populations -- using the BoxWidget in the scene, the user
        can drag it over a population of cells, and can then press the
        "Replace" or "Accumulate" buttons on the SelectField's UI to
        replace/accumulate the "Selection Value" into the nodes within
        the box.  Lastly, via the SetupFVMatrix UI, the user can
        specify the output file locations, can choose whether or not
        to perform Cuthill-McKee bandwidth minimization, and can set
        the conductivity velocities for the eigen-directions of both
        cell types.  This new also saves out a vector of cell-types
        (re-ordered if bandwidth minimization was performed) as a
        SCIRun ColumnMatrix.

As a side-result of running the above net (cw3), we have saved off
        Vector fields containing the primary and secondary fiber
        directions resampled to our hexahedral mesh.  These can be
        visualized using cw4:show-interpolated-fibers.net
   % ../../../scirun cw4:show-interpolated-fibers.net

Having generated the input files for CardioWave, we can now run
        simulations to output activation times.  First, though, we
        must convert the cell-type ColumnMatrix into a CardioWave .vec
        file.  We do this using another SCIRun converter:
   % cd $DUKEDATA
   % $SCIRUN/src/Packages/CardioWave/StandAlone/convert/ColumnMatToCardioWave \
     sr-data/0.1.32.ct.mat cw-data/0.1.32.ct.vec
	After the file has been converted, we run CardioWave, which
        produces 0.1.32.act.vec (the activation times for each cell)
        and 0.1.32.time.vm (the time-series voltage for each cell).
        We can convert those into SCIRun format using the
        CardioWaveToColumnMat (for the activation times) and
        CardioWaveToDenseMat (for the time-series) converters.
   % $SCIRUN/src/Packages/CardioWave/StandAlone/convert/CardioWaveToColumnMat \
     cw-data/0.1.32.act.vec sr-data/0.1.32.act.mat
   % $SCIRUN/src/Packages/CardioWave/StandAlone/convert/CardioWaveToDenseMat \
     9678 301 cw-data/0.1.32.time.vm sr-data/0.1.32.time.mat

Now we are ready to visualize the simulation results in SCIRun.  We
        can see the activation times using
        cw5:show-activation-times.net
   % cd $SCIRUN/src/Packages/CardioWave/nets
   % ../../../scirun cw5:show-activation-times.net
        [NOTE: at the moment, the GenStandardColorMaps module is
        having some problems -- on its UI, grab the slider that's all
        the way to the left and showing "12" and drag it to the right
        till it's at around "60", then release.  The author promises
        to fix this soon...]
And we can visualize the time-series data using
        cw6:show-time-series-voltages.net
   % ../../../scirun cw6:show-time-series-voltages.net
	Using the UI on the MatrixSelectVector, we can choose which
        row (time-step) from the data set to visualize by dragging the
        "Row #" slider.  Once we've chosen a time-step we're
        interested in, pressing the "Execute" button will send it
        downstream to be rendered.  If the "Animate" box is selected,
        then the next time the module is executed, it will begin
        marching through time-steps, sending them downstream one after
        the other.  The animation can be stopped by pressing the
        "Stop" button.
	[Same NOTE: as above applies to GenStandardColorMaps.]



Dumping an Image or Making A Movie 
==================================

To dump the ViewWindow rendering to an output file, just click the "+"
button at the bottom-right of the ViewWindow.  In the "Record Movie
as:" box on the left, type the name of the file you want to save to,
and press the "Raw Frames" button once... then press the "Stop
Recording" button.  This will dump one raw file that you can convert
use rawtorle (or some such program).

To dump a movie, you do essentially the same things, except that you
press the "Mpeg" button, and leave it selected for as long as you want
it to add frames.  Make sure you press "Stop Recording" before you
quit SCIRun, so it can close the output file correctly.

To create a camera path, add an EditPath module to your net
(SCIRun->Render->EditPath) and attach its second output port (purple)
to a Viewer module input port.  




General Notes on Using SCIRun
=============================

Read through the SCIRun User Guide at:
     http://ampano.cs.utah.edu/software/doc/index.html

After you've started SCIRun with a net file as an argument, typically
everything will come up but none of the modules will actually
execute.  You can force an exection by placing your mouse over a
module icon (around the name) and clicking the right-mouse-button.
This will reveal a menu -- select "Execute" from the menu and that
module will fire (as will all of the upstream modules it needs data
from and all of the donwstream modules it's sending data to).

To interact with a box frame widget (as in cw3), you can select the
parts of the widget by pressing the shift-button and clicking on the
piece with the left-mouse-button.  By selecting the frame (gray), you
can move the box around.  Selecting the green cylinders allows you to
resize the box in each dimension.  The blue balls allow you to rotate
the box, and the brown cylinders allow you to specify
application-specific values -- you shouldn't select either of them
with this application.

When viewing data in the ViewWindow, it's often useful to use "Fog" to
make closer things appear brighter and more distant things dimmer
(point clouds, vector fields, etc).  Fog can be enabled by clicking
the "+" button on the bottom-right of the ViewWindow and selecting the
"Fog" box on the left.  It's also useful to make points show up as
larger than one pixel (for point clouds) -- to change the size of
points, select "PointSize" from the "Edit" menu at the top of the
ViewWindow.

Running any of the converter programs without any arguments will give
you back usage information.
