    <summary>Change the conductivity tensors in a field.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        ModifyConductivities is used to interactively change the
conductivity tensors in a field.  These tensors are then used by many
BioPSE modules to create the support matrices that are then used to
solve forward and inverse problems.
      </p>
      <p>
	The tensors are stored as a 'conductivities' property in the
input and output fields.  The fields should be of integer type and
contain indices into this conductivities table.  The indices start at
value zero.  Internally the table consists of a vector of entry pairs,
each containing the tensor and a reference name.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'Tensor Matrix' input port is optional.  If there is an
Nx9 or 9xN matrix present on that port, then default conductivities
will be extracted from that matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generating the GUI table can become intractable as the number
of entries in the table grows.  The default is to not generate the GUI
table if there are more than 250 entries.  You can force the GUI to
update anyway by checking the "Force GUI Update" button.  It is not
recommended that you do so with more than a thousand or so entries.
