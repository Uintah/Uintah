    <summary>The module sets up mesh with conductivity tensors and
      Dirichlet boundary conditions specifically for bioelectric field
      probles
    </summary>
    
    <description>
      <p>Version Date: March 2001</p><p>Version: 1.0</p>
      <p>The module provides basic means for construction FE matrix
      with linear elements for bioelectric field problem
      (discretization of Poisson equation for volume conductor
      problem). Input field is  supposed to have properties with lookup
      naming correspondent to bioelectric field problem. Below are the
      conventions for the module:</p>
      
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <p>Field containing mesh should be of type TetVol(char),
	  containing indices to the property 'table', that contains
	  actual values of the conductivity tensors. In this way the
	  storage is optimized</p>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <p>Property of the conductivity mesh name 'table' should
	  have assosiated data object of type Array1(Tensor). Any
	  lookup into the table is done by dereferencing indices of
	  conductivity mesh</p>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <p>Dirichlet boundary conditions , if any, should be
	  represented as property with name "dirichlet" and be of type
	  vector(pair(int, double)), where "int" field corresponds to
	  node index, and "double" field is the value of potential at
	  the node</p>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      
      <note>
	<p>The actual computation of the matrix is done by the
	BioPSE::Algorithm::BuildFEMatrix::build_FEMatrix(). Other
	modules or any other code could use the algorithm for other
	kinds of problems involving discretization of Poisson equation
	in 3D by linear finite elements</p>
      </note>
      
      <developer>
	<p>The discretization of the Poisson equation on the supplied
	mesh is done by linear finite elements using Galerkin approach</p>
      </developer>
