    <summary>The module sets up a mesh with conductivity tensors for
      bioelectric field problems.
    </summary>
    
    <description>
      <p>Version Date: March 2001</p><p>Version: 1.0</p>

      <p>The module provides basic means for construction of the FE
      matrix with linear elements for bioelectric field problems
      (discretization of Poisson equation for volume conductor
      problem). The input field should be a Field (TriSurf,
      HexVol, or TetVol) of either Tensors or integers, with the data
      values defined at the elements (constant over each element).  If
      it is a Field of Tensors, each Tensor indicates the local
      conductivity tensor at that location in the mesh.  If it is a
      Field of Integers, then each integer is an index into a lookup
      table, where the table contains a set of conductivity tensors.
      When using the index/table approach, a "conductivity_table"
      Property must be stored with the Field, where the conductivity
      table is of type pair&lt;string,Tensor> (i.e. the individual
      material types can have descriptive names).  The
      BioPSE::Modeling::ModifyConductivities module can be used to
      generate (as well as to modify) the conductivity_table
      property.  The BioPSE::Forward::IndicesToTensors and
      BioPSE::Forward::TensorsToIndices modules are useful for
      converting between the index/table (Field of integer with a
      conductivity_table Propert) and the full Tensor (Field of
      Tensors) representations.</p>
      
      <note>
	<p>BioPSE::Algorithm::BuildFEMatrix::build_FEMatrix() performs
	the actual computation of the matrix. Other modules or any
	other code may use the algorithm for other kinds of problems
	involving discretization of the Poisson equation by
	linear finite elements.</p>

	<p>The discretization of the Poisson equation on the supplied
	mesh is performed by linear finite elements using Galerkin
	approach.</p>

      <label>Use Conductivities</label>
      <description>
	<p>
          The "Use Conductivities" box tells the module to look up the
          conductivity for each element and to use that information
          when constructing the stiffness matrix.  If it is not
          checked, the module will use the identity matrix for each
          element instead (i.e. what was div(sigma x grad(phi)) turns
          into div(grad(phi))).  This is useful for demonstrating the
          effects of volumetric inhomogeneities on the electric field.
          And in practice, it's also a useful debugging tools -- you
          can immediately see if a solution that isn't converging or
          is giving strange results is getting screwed up because of
          bad conductivity values or because of something else
          (e.g. something is wrong with the mesh).

      <label>Use Conductivity Basis Matrices</label>
      <description>
	<p>
          The "Use Conductivity Basis Matrices" is just an efficiency
          option for the case where the user wants to experiment with
          varying the conductivity for some of the materials.  Note:
          it only works with isotropic materials, and when we have an
          indexed table of Tensors (i.e. a Field&lt;int> with a
          conductivity_table Property, rather than a Field&lt;Tensor>
          where each element has a unique Tensor).  This option will
          precompute a decomposition of A into:
	</p><p>
          A = sigma_1 x A'_1 + sigma_2 x A'_2 + ... sigma_N x A'_N 
	</p><p>
          where the A'_n matrices are the same size and structure (in
          the sparse matrix sense) as A, but just contain
          contributions from elements of material type n.  The sigma_n
          values are just the isotropic conductivities of the
          different materials.  If this box is checked, we build this
          decomposition.  Then, when a new Field comes in, the module
          will check to make sure that only the conductivity_table has
          changed, and will regenerate A by adding together weighted
          contributions from the basis matrices, A'_n.  In practice
          this approach is extremely useful for the parameterized
          conductivity search application that's implement in
          Packages/BioPSE/nets/conductivity-search.net
