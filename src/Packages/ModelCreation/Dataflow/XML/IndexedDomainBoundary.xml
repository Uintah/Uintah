      This module will extract the inner and outer boundaries from a mesh. 
      An inner boundary is defined as the boundary between different regions 
      with a different value on the elements. The outer boundary is the
      boundary that surround the mesh.

      This module will extract the inner and outer boundaries from a mesh. 
      An inner boundary is defined as the boundary between different regions 
      with a different value on the elements. The outer boundary is the
      boundary that surround the mesh. In the GUI one can selectively set
      which boundaries are extracted from the mesh. One can set the range
      of values on the segmented field for which one wants to extract the
      boundary separating the different compartments. Within this range of
      selected domains one can select only the inner boundaries to this 
      selected domain or one can get the boundary surrounding the selected
      domains. 
      </p>
      <p>
      This module is intended to extract the boundaries in a segmented field.
      The module is templated and should work on any mesh type as long as the
      data is assigned to the elements.
