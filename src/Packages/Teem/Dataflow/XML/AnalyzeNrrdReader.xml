    <summary>Convert Analyze data to the NRRD format which can be used
in SCIRun networks.
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p> This module provides support for converting <ulink
url="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/Common/analyze_fmt.shtml">Analyze</ulink> 
data to the <ulink
url="http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/index.html">NRRD</ulink> format
which can be used in SCIRun networks. An important point is that this
module is dependent on the Insight package, so both the Teem and
Insight packages have to be enabled in the SCIRun build in order for
the AnalyzeNrrdReader converter to work.
      </p> 
      <p> Some brief background information about the Analyze format
will be helpful in understanding how to load data using the
AnalyzeNrrdReader reader.  For a detailed description of the Analyze
format, please refer to the documentation pages for <ulink
url="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/Common/analyze_fmt.shtml">Analyze</ulink>.
      </p>
      <p> Analyze files contain volume data, often from MRI.  The
Analyze format includes two different files for each volume:  a header
(extension ".hdr") file and and image (extension ".img") file.  All of
the image data for a volume is contained in a single image file. Since
these files come in pairs, the AnalyzeNrrdReader module requires the
user to specify a ".hdr" file to read. Then the module looks for the
corresponding ".img" file in the same directory as the ".hdr" file.  
      </p>
      <p> The AnalyzeNrrdReader module requires the user to specify a
directory containing the data files.  One or more Analyze files may be
selected for processing.  If the files are recognized as valid Analyze
format, they are read in and converted to the NRRD format which can
then be passed downstream to certain other SCIRun modules.
