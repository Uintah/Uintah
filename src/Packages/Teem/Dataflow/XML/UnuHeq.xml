    <summary>Perform histogram equalization. If this seems to be doing
nothing, try increasing the number of histograms bins by an order of
magnitude or two (or more). Or, use "unu gamma" to warp the values in
the direction you know they need to go. Either of these might work
because extremely tall and narrow peaks in the equalization histogram
will produce poor results.</summary>

      <p>Bins: the number of bins to use in histogram that is created
in order to calculate the mapping that achieves the equalization.
(int)</p>
      <p>SBins: the number bins in value histogram to ignore in
calculating the mapping. Bins are ignored when they get more hits than
other bins, and when the values that fall in them are constant. This
is an effective way to prevent large regions of background value from
distorting the equalization mapping. default: "0"</p>
      <p>Amount: extent to which the histogram equalizing mapping
should be applied; 0.0: no change, 1.0: full equalization (float);
default: "1.0"</p>
