    <summary>Quantize directions of diffusion. Because VTK doesn't do
multi-dimensional colormaps, we have to quantize directions of diffusion
(usually just the principal eigenvector) in order to create the usual
XYZ-RGB coloring. Because eigenvector directions are poorly defined in
regions of low anisotropy, the length of the vector (pre-quantization) is
modulated by anisotropy, requiring the selection of some anisotropy metric.

    <p>Quantize directions of diffusion. Because VTK doesn't do
multi-dimensional colormaps, we have to quantize directions of diffusion
(usually just the principal eigenvector) in order to create the usual
XYZ-RGB coloring. Because eigenvector directions are poorly defined in
regions of low anisotropy, the length of the vector (pre-quantization) is
modulated by anisotropy, requiring the selection of some anisotropy metric.</p>
    <p>Evec Index : Which eigenvector should be quantized: a value of 0 for the
    direction of fastest diffusion (eigenvector associated with
    largest eigenvalue), values 1 or 2 for other two eigenvectors
    (associated with middle and smallest eigenvalue) (integer).</p>
    <p>Anisotropy Metric: Which anisotropy metric to plot. 
    All the Westin metrics come in two versions. Currently supported:
           cl1, cl2: Westin's linear;
           cp1, cp2: Westin's planar;
           ca1, ca2: Westin's linear + planar;
           cs1, cs2: Westin's spherical (1-ca);
           ct1, ct2: GK's anisotropy type (cp/ca);
           ra: Basser/Pierpaoli relative anisotropy;
           fa: Basser/Pierpaoli fractional anisotropy/sqrt(2);
           vf: volume fraction = 1-(Basser/Pierpaoli volume ratio);
           tr: trace.</p>
    <p>Don't Attenuate the color by Anisotropy : When not selected, 
    regions with low or no anisotropy are very dark colors or black.</p>
