    <p>Create (PGM) image of 1-D value histogram</p>
    <p>Height: height of output image (horizontal size is determined by
    number of bins in input histogram). This value should be an integer.</p>
    <p>Show log-scaled hisogram: will show the log-scaled histogram with decade
    tick-marks.</p>
    <p>Max Number of Hits: constrain the top of the drawn histogram to be at 
    this number of hits. This will either scale the drawn histogram
    downward or clip its top, depending on whether the given
    max is higher or lower than the actual maximum bin count. This value
    should be a double.
    This value is only used when Use Max Number of Hits is checked. If not 
    checked, the actual maximum bin count is used.</p>
