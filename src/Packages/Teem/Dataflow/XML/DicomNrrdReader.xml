    <summary>Convert DICOM data to the NRRD format which can be used
in SCIRun networks.
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p> This module provides support for converting <ulink
url="http://www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/staff/cr1/dicom.html">DICOM</ulink> 
data to the <ulink
url="http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/index.html">NRRD</ulink> format
which can be used in SCIRun networks. An important point is that this
module is dependent on the Insight package, so both the Teem and
Insight packages have to be enabled in the SCIRun build in order for
the DicomNrrdReader converter to work.
      </p> 
      <p> Some brief background information about the DICOM format
will be helpful in understanding how to load data using the
DicomNrrdReader reader.  For a detailed description of the DICOM
format, please refer to the documentation pages for <ulink
url="http://www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/staff/cr1/dicom.html">DICOM</ulink>.Also, 
note that the DICOM format is "flexible", meaning that implementations
tend to vary slightly, so the descriptions that follow are not
guaranteed to be universally applicable.
      </p>
      <p> DICOM is a standard file format that stores volume data from
computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and
ultrasound.  Each DICOM file has a header that is followed by image
data.   While a single DICOM file can contain image data for multiple
slices of scanned data, usually each DICOM file contains only one
image frame corresponding to one slice.  For example, for a scan
consisting of 60 slices, there would most likely be 60 DICOM files.
This logical grouping of DICOM files is called a series.  As a result,
when loading DICOM data using the DicomNrrdReader module, one or more
series' each containing one or more files can be loaded.
      </p>
      <p> The DicomNrrdReader module requires the user to specify a
directory containing the data files.  One or more series' of DICOM
files can be selected for processing.  If the files are recognized as
valid DICOM format, they are read in and converted to the NRRD format
which can then be passed downstream to certain other SCIRun modules.
