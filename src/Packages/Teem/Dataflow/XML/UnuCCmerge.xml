    <summary>Merge CCs with their neighbors, under various contraints. This
operates on the output of "ccfind". Merging of a CC is always done into its
largest neighbor. Whether or not to merge can be constrained by one or more
of: CC size (-s), original CC value being brighter or darker (-d), and
number of neighbors (-n).

    <p>>Merge CCs with their neighbors, under various contraints. This
operates on the output of "ccfind". Merging of a CC is always done into its
largest neighbor. Whether or not to merge can be constrained by one or more
of: CC size (-s), original CC value being brighter or darker (-d), and
number of neighbors (-n).</p>
    <p>Value Driven Merging : do value-driven merging. Using 1 says that
    dark islands get merged with bright surrounds, while -1
    says the opposite. A value of 0 indicates merging can go either way.</p>
    <p>Max Size : a cap on the CC size that will be absorbed into its
    surround. CCs larger than this are deemed too significant
    to mess with. Or, a value of 0 removes any such restriction
    on merging.</p>
    <p>Max Neighbors : a cap on the number of neighbors that a CC may have 
    if it is to be be merged. A value of 1 allows only islands to be merged,
    a value of 2 does merging with bigger of two neighbors, etc, while
    a value of 0 says that number of neighbors is no constraint.</p>
    <p>Connectivity : what kind of connectivity to use: the number of
    coordinates that vary in order to traverse the
    neighborhood of a given sample. In 2D: 1 : 4-connected,
    2 : 8-connected</p>
