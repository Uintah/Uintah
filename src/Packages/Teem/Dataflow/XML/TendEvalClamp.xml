    <summary>Modify shape by clamping eigenvalues in some
range.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>Modify shape by clamping eigenvalues in some range. The
orientation of the tensor is unchanged. Note that unlike tend anscale,
this operation can completely change the shape of the tensor.</p>
      <p>Min :  Eigenvalues are clamped from below by this (the
minimum output eigenvalue). Use nan to signify that no minimum
clamping should be done. This value should be a float.</p>
      <p>Max : Eigenvalues are clamped from above by this (the maximum
output eigenvalue). Use nan to signify that no maximum clamping should
be done. This value should be a float.</p>
