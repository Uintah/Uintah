    <summary>Modify shape by clamping eigenvalues in some range.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>Modify shape by clamping eigenvalues in some range. The
orientation of the tensor is unchanged. Note that unlike tend anscale, this
operation can completely change the shape of the tensor.</p>
      <p>Min :  Eigenvalues are clamped from below by this (the minimum output
      eigenvalue). Use nan to signify that no minimum clamping should
     be done. This value should be a float.</p>
      <p>Max : Eigenvalues are clamped from above by this (the maximum output
      eigenvalue). Use nan to signify that no maximum clamping should
      be done. This value should be a float.</p>
