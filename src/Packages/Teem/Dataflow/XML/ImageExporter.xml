    <summary>Output a Nrrd as an image file.</summary>
    <description>

      <p>ImageExporter uses the ImageMagick libaries to convert a Nrrd
into an image file in one of the many formats supported by
ImageMagick.  The Nrrd can be G, RGB, or RGBA data consisting of
unsigned characters, unsigned shorts, floats, or doubles.  If the data
is float or double then it should be between 0 and 1. See <modref
package="Teem" name="ImageImporter"/> for more on the data format.</p>
