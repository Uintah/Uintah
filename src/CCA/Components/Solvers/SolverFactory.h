CLASS
   SolverFactory
   
   Main class of the Solvers component.

GENERAL INFORMATION

   File: SolverFactory.h

   Steven G. Parker
   Department of Computer Science
   University of Utah

   Center for the Simulation of Accidental Fires and Explosions (C-SAFE)
  

KEYWORDS
   SolverFactory, SolverInterface, ProblemSpecP.

DESCRIPTION
   Class SolverFactory arbitrates between different solvers for an
   elliptic equation (normally, a pressure equation in implicit ICE;
   pressure defined at cell-centered). It is created in StandAlone/sus.cc.
   We support our own solvers (CGSolver) and several Hypre library solvers
   and preconditioners, among which: PFMG, SMG, FAC, AMG, CG. Solver
   arbitration is based on input file parameters.
  
WARNING
   Make sure to comment out any solver that is not completed yet, otherwise
   sus cannot pass linking.
