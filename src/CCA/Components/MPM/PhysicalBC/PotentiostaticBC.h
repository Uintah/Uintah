CLASS
  PotentiostaticBC

    Uniform external mass flux boundary condition for MPM.

GENERAL INFORMATION
  PotentiostaticBC.h

  Justin Hooper
  Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Utah

DESCRIPTION

   Allows for imposition of a potentiostatic (constant mass flux) boundary
   condition which is applied to particles on the surface particles present
   on the surface of the geometry represented by the intersection of the material
   points within the system and the volume of the boundary.  A buffer of
   length(Dot (0.5*dX,0.5*dX)) is used to buffer the boundary of the boundary
   condition externally by default, but this can be set to an arbitrary positive
   value if desired.

WARNING
   The particles marked as surface particles are determined at initiation of the
   problem execution.  As such there is no guarantee they will remain at a
   surface throughout the entire problem run length.  The assumption is therefore
   made that the surface remains topologically consistent and exposed throughout
   the entire time domain.
