GENERAL INFORMATION
    MixingRxnTable.h - representation of reaction and mixing table data 
    structure (typically an external file in a pre-specified format).

KEYWORDS
    Mixing Table 

DESCRIPTION
    This MixingRxnTable class provides a representation of the mixing 
    and reaction table inside the Arches code (specifically, Properties.cc).  
    The MixingRxnTable class is a generic class that allows for child classes 
    that each provide a specific representation of specific mixing and 
    reaction table formats.  That way, we can use a standard table format, 
    but leave ourselves the flexibility to move to other reaction and mixing 
    table formats in the future.

    Tables can be created in any number of programs (DARS, Cantera, TabProps, 
    etc.).  Implementing this table reader is part of an effort to convert our 
    current table format (which does not use a universal format) to an HDF5 
    B-Splined format, which is what TabProps creates (TabProps is a code 
    written by Dr. James Sutherland and is available through the CRSim software
    SVN repository).

PATTERNS
    None

WARNINGS
    For now, the MixingRxnTable object will be able to read several table formats 
    (or, at least, it will not be the only method available for reading tables).  
    However, ultimately the MixingRxnTable object will be the only interface 
    between Arches and tables, and will only interface with a single, common, 
    uniform table format (HDF5).  However, the format of the MixingRxnTable is 
    such that a new child class can easily be created if a different table 
    format is decided upon.
