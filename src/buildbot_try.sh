# The purpose of this script is to test changes you have made to your local SVN repository
# by shipping those changes to the Uintah buildbot server to run tests against.
#
#
# Before you can run this script, the "buildbot" package must be installed on your computer.
#
# - On Debian (as root) you can run: apt-get install buildbot
#
#
# Other caveats:
#
# - You can't run the try if you have new files in your tree...  The only way around this is
#     to "svn commit" the new files first.
#
#
# This is an example of a successful submission:
#
#   % ./buildbot_try_test.sh

# Buildbot test script. Execute this script in the top level source dir:
# i.e. /Uintah/trunk/src

# 1. Before running this script the src code must be fully up to date.

# 2. If you are adding new files they must be checked in first.

# 3. There are some other gotchas regarding svn ...

# 4. There are different try servers
#   --builder option 

#   where option is one of the following:
#     Linux-Optimize-Test-try
#     Linux-Debug-Test-try
#     Linux-Optimize-GPU-try

#  If no builder is specified all will be used.
