(Per Tony's earlier readme.txt)
This directory contains a widely used test case for verifying your turbulence model. 
The case consists of a isotropic-turbulence initial conditions that decay over time. 
The initial conditions correspond to periodic grids of sizes 32x32x32 and 64x64x64, respectively. These are provided by the files:

cbc32_uvw_arches.gz

cbc64_uvw_arches.gz

The cbc terminology is in honor of the original experiment by Comte-Bellot and Corrsin in which they generated grid turbulence and extracted plenty of statistics including energy spectra.

Use the getTKE.py script to run the test, extract the data, and generate the comparison plots.  Type "python getTKE.py --help" for more information. 

Note that the getTKE.py script assumes you will step at dt=1e-2 or dt=1e-3 depending on the CFL conditions for your case so that the CBC data can be plotted against the correct timestep of the simulation.
