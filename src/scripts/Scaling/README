To perform a scalability test copy the tarball "copyRenameThisDir.tar.gz" to the machine of interest and 
untar it.  

- Copy src/scripts/Scaling/extract* to new directory


- Edit the files 

 extractScalingData
 extractSolverScalingData
 generate.sh
 runsus.sh
 
 to suit your needs and the machine's batch scheduling system.  

- Make a symbolic link or a copy of sus in the directory.

- Replace the skel.example file and edit or add any fields that you'd like to vary.  See
  generate.sh:modify_ups()

To test your changes:
  
  - edit small/generate.sh and comment out qsub -N $JOB.
  - run small/generate.sh
  - examine the input files generated in 
              small/inputs
  - if the ups files are correct uncommment that line.
  

General advice:
  - Start by running the small/  low node count cases first.
    After the runs are complete run the script
       postProcessRuns
    and examine the scalability.  
  - Proceed to the larger cases/ higher node counts after you've verifed the "machinery" is working correctly.

Below is the directory structure created by copyRenameThisDir.tar.gz and a brief description of the scripts.

Inputs:       Directory filled with ups files that were created by running "generate.sh."
output:       Directory filled with output from sus.  One file for each node count.
generate.sh:  Shell script that modifies the skeleton ups file for each node count defined.  It also  
              submits that batch job to the scheduler.  Editing required.
