The run_doxygen.sh script is run nightly via a cron job on inferno2.

You can edit/create the crontab by running the command (from inferno2):

(As user 'csafe-tester':)

> crontab -e

The crontab file should look something like this:

# mail any output to `dav', no matter whose crontab this is
MAILTO=dav@sci.utah.edu
#
# run five minutes after 1am, every day
5 1 * * *       cd $HOME/DoxygenCheckout/SCIRun/src/Packages/Uintah && scripts/doxygen/run_doxygen.sh


NOTE: Currently the cron job is run as user 'csafe-tester' on blaze.
