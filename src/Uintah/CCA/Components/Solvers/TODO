TODO List - Solvers Component
=============================
* HypreSolver (assuming it's not obsolete yet):
  - Matrix file - why are ghosts there?
  - 3D performance
  - Logging?
  - Report mflops
  - Use a symmetric matrix (does the current implementation work?)
  - More efficient set?
* CGSolver:
  - dynamic compilation tests
  - Bench on cluster
  - Can we do any better?  Tiling? ???
* DirectSolver could be made somewhat faster by using a banded matrix.
* Reuse some data between solves? (initial guess, setup phase?)
* Separate setup from solver phase in solvers. Some solvers can be
  more efficient by separating the setup phase that depends
  on A only, from the solution stage, that depends on A, b, x.
* Read hypre options from input file.
* Prepare initial guess in ICE or create our own by a CCVariable<double>
  (e.g. filled with zeros) attached to _HX.
* Add conversion Struct -> SStruct -> ParCSR for complicated diffusion
  1-level problems that need AMG.
* Can Hypre 1.7.7 work with SStruct and AMG? It does not have the function
  of setting graph to PARCSR type. Does it matter?
* advect_impAMR_oren.ups AMRSolver test:
  - Correctly scale A at C/F (see impICE.cc dt^2/dx thing).
  - Patch boundaries are marked wrong for 4x4x4 patch 0, 4x4x4 patch 1
    (x+,y+,z+ should also be C/F boundaries but marked as "None" = domain
    boundaries).
* Check AMRSolver on multiple processors, different grid (patch/proc ownership)
  configurations.

Done:
=====
* Put hypre 1.9 #ifdef only around FAC, because AMG and sstruct already
  exist in Hypre 1.7.7b. Correct sub.mk's as well.
* AMRSolver:
  - C-C connection at C/f boundary correctly zeroed out. Needed to define
    "opposite" = inward normal of fine patch at C/F boundary.       
  - Diagonal element on fine patch is missing. Counters of graph entries
    for both C, F patches introduced.
