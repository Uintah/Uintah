Description of current directories:

Advection - 1D compatible flux advection operator test. 

Regrider - AMR patch generation algorithm (clustering from refinement
          flags) in matlab. Both Berger-Rigotsous (BR directory) for
          2 levels and hierarchical (for multi-level) are supported.

ShockTube1D - Oren's modified 1D shock tube simulation of ICE,
          building on Todd's code and adding some printouts, bug
          corrections, etc,
          October 2004 - May 2005.

SolverBug - matlab scripts and data files comparing the Uintah and
          Hypre matrices in implicit ICE (one level, not AMR),
          July 2005.
