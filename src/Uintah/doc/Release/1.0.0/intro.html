<h1>Uintah Software Overview</h1>

The primary objective of C-SAFE is to provide a software
system in which fundamental chemistry and engineering physics are
fully coupled with nonlinear solvers, visualization, and experimental
data verification, thereby integrating expertise from a wide variety
of disciplines.  Simulations using this system will help to better
evaluate the risks and safety issues associated with fires and
explosions in accidents involving both hydrocarbon and energetic
materials.

<h2>Target Simulation</h2>

The Uintah software system was designed to support the solution of a
wide range of highly dynamic physical processes on a large number of
processors.  <img src="Images/explosion1_tn.jpg" alt="End-to-end

hspace="10" /> Specifically, our target simulation is the heating of a
explosive device placed in a large hydrocarbon pool fire and the
subsequent deflagration explosion and blast wave.  The explosive
device is a small cylindrical steel container (4" outside diameter)
filled with plastic bonded explosive (PBX-9501).  Convective and
radiative heat fluxes from the fire heat the outside of the container
and the PBX.  After some amount of time the critical temperature in
the PBX is reached and the explosive begins to rapidly decompose into
a gas.  The solid->gas reaction pressurizes the interior of the steel
container causing the shell to rapidly expand and eventually rupture.
The gaseous products of reaction form a blast wave that expands
outward along with pieces of the container and the unreacted PBX. The
physical processes in this simulation have a wide range in time and
length scales from microseconds and microns to minutes and meters.  An
example of this simulation is depicted in this image.  Uintah is
designed to be a general-purpose fluid-structure code that will
simulate not only this scenario but a wide range of related problems.
<p/>
Complex simulations such as this require both immense computational
power and complex software.  Typical simulations include solvers for
structural mechanics, fluids, chemical reactions, and material models.
All of these aspects must be integrated in an efficient manner to
achieve the scalability required to perform these simulations.  The
heart of Uintah is a sophisticated computational framework that can
integrate multiple simulation components, analyze the dependencies and
communication patterns between them, and efficiently execute the
resulting multi-physics simulation.  Uintah also provides mechanisms
for automating load-balancing, checkpoint/restart, and parallel I/O.
The Uintah core is designed to be general, and is appropriate for use
for a wide range of PDE algorithms based on structured (possibly
adaptive) grids and particle-in-cell algorithms.

<h2>Uintah Computational Framework (UCF)</h2>

The Uintah Computational Framework consists of a set of software
components and libraries that facilitate the solution of Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs) on Structured AMR (SAMR) grids using
hundreds to thousands of processors.
<p/>
One of the challenges in designing a parallel, component-based
multi-physics application is determining how to efficiently decompose
the problem domain.  Components, by definition, make local decisions.
Yet parallel efficiency is only obtained through a globally optimal
domain decomposition and scheduling of computational tasks.  Typical
techniques include allocating disjoint sets of processing resources to
each component, or defining a single domain decomposition that is a
compromise between the ideal load balance of multiple components.
However, neither of these techniques will achieve maximum efficiency
for complex multi-physics problems.
<p/>
Uintah uses a non-traditional approach to achieving parallelism,
employing an abstract taskgraph representation to describe computation
and communication.  The taskgraph is an explicit representation of the
computation and communication that occur in the coarse of a single
iteration of the simulation (typically a timestep or nonlinear solver
iteration).  Uintah components delegate decisions about parallelism to
a scheduler component, using variable dependencies to describe
communication patterns and characterizing computational workloads to
facilitate a global resource optimization.  The taskgraph
representation has a number of advantages, including efficient
fine-grained coupling of multi-physics components, flexible load
balancing mechanisms and a separation of application concerns from
parallelism concerns.  However, it creates a challenge for scalability
which we overcome by creating an implicit definition of this graph and
representing it in a distributed fashion.
<p/>
The primary advantage of a component-based approach is that it
facilitates the separate development of simulation algorithms, models,
and infrastructure.  Components of the simulation can evolve
independently.  Since C-SAFE is a research project, we need to
accommodate the fact that most of the software is still under
development.  The component-based architecture allows pieces of the
system to be implemented in a rudimentary form at first and then
evolve as the technologies mature.  Most importantly, Uintah allows
the aspects of parallelism (schedulers, load-balancers, parallel
input/output, and so forth) to evolve independently of the simulation
components.  This approach allows the computer science effort to focus
on these problems without waiting for the completion of the scientific
applications or vice-versa.  Furthermore, components enable
replacement of computation pieces without complex decision logic in
the code itself.
