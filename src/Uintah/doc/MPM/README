The LaTeX files are designed to be converted into PDF files
by default (using: pdflatex <texfile>).  If you want to 
create postscript files you have to comment out the pdftex
lines and uncomment the dvips lines in the preambles. You
also have to comment out the includegraphics of pdf files
and uncomment the includegrpahics of eps files.  Then 
create the dvi files (using: latex <texfile>).  The dvi files
can be converted into PS using dvips.
