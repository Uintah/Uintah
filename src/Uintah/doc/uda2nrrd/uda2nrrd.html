<h1>Using uda2nrrd, unu, and SCIRun::Teem to inspect data</h1>

<h2>What can these tools do for you?</h2>

<ol>
<li>uda2nrrd can be used to extract values of a field.  Fields are
specified by variable name, material, and timestep.</li>
<li>unu can be used to inspect and process data remotely or
locally</li>
<li>The Teem package in SCIRun can be used to visualize data similar
to how you do it with the Uintah package</li>
</ol>

<h2>A brief introduction to nrrd, unu, and teem</h2>

<p>teem is a collection of libraries and utilities which aid in the
processing and exploration of rasterized data.  Full documentation for
teem can be found at its <a href="http://teem.sourceforge.net">home</a>
at sourceforge.
</p>

<p>The primary data format used by teem is called <a
href="http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/index.html">nrrd</a> (Nearly
Raw Raster Data) and pronounced "nerd".  The format consists of an
ASCII header followed by the data (raw or ASCII).  The headers were
designed to be human readable/writable while maintaining the raw data.
Headers can be either attached (the head of the file preceeding the
data) or detached.  These are designated with .nrrd and .nhdr
extensions respectfully.  Detached headers can use any name for a raw
file, but the default is .raw.  More detail on the file format can be
found <a href="http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/format.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>The nrrd library comes with many functions for manipulating nrrd
files.  Many of these hese functions have been wrapped into a stand
alone utility called unu (Utah Nrrd Utilites) and pronounced U-N-U
(also referred to as unrrdu).  There is extensive <a
href="http://teem.sourceforge.net/unrrdu/index.html">documentation</a>
for unu on the web.
</p>

<p>unu will read and write nrrd files from either a file or from
standard in and out ("-" can be used as the file name to specify
stdin/out when the default does not use stdin/out).  By using unix
pipes ("|") you can chain together several commands to perform more
complex operations without the use of intermediate files.  I'll show
some examples later.
</p>

<h2>uda2nrrd</h2>

<p>uda2nrrd extracts a field from an uda and writes a nrrd file.  The
user must specify the uda file and a variable name.  All other options
have default values.</p>

<h3>Uda Specifier Option</h3>

<ul>
<li>-uda &lt;archive&gt; Required argument to specify name of uda file</li>
</ul>

<h3>Field Specifier Options</h3>

<ul>
<li>-v,--variable &lt;variable name&gt;</li>
<li>-m,--material &lt;material number&gt; [defaults to first material found]</li>
<li>-l,--level &lt;level index&gt; [defaults to 0]</li>
<li>-mo &lt;operator&gt; type of operator to apply to matricies.
Options are none, det, norm, and trace [defaults to none]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Timestep Specifier Options</h3>

<ul>
<li>-tlow,--timesteplow [int] (only outputs timestep from int) [defaults to 0]</li>
<li>-thigh,--timestephigh [int] (only outputs timesteps up to int) [defaults to last timestep]</li>
<li>-tinc [int] (output every n timesteps) [defaults to 1]</li>
<li>-tstep,--timestep [int] (only outputs timestep int)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output Options</h3>

<ul>
<li>-o,--out &lt;output file name root&gt; [defaults to the name of the
variable followed by the material number]  The index of the timestep
will be appended to this argument.</li>
<li>-dh,--detatched-header - writes the data with detached headers.
The default action is to write files with attached headers.  The file
extension will now be .nhdr instead of .nrrd.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chatty Options</h3>

<ul>
<li>-vv,--verbose Output is more chatty (also prints out list of
material numbers for given variable).</li>
<li>-q,--quiet Very little output</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other usage notes</h3>

<p>If you run uda2nrrd with no arguments the usage is printed.  If you
want to know how many timesteps and what variables are in the uda run
uda2nrrd with only the archive argument.
</p>

<h3>Examples of use</h3>

<ul>
<li>To see the list of variables supply only the archive name.<br />

<h2>unu</h2>

<p>The most useful thing that you can do with unu is make images to
view the data.  By using a combination of unu commands and xv you can
view the data without ever having to create intermediate data files.
Data from one use of unu goes to stdout and is read by the next on
stdin.  The following command will quantize your data to 8 bits
(uchars), format the data into an image formate (pnm is used for
ppm:color and pgm:grayscale images), and then piped to xv (the "-"
says read from stdin).

<blockquote><pre>
unu quantize -b 8 | unu save -f pnm | xv -
</pre></blockquote>
This bit of code is so useful that you should alias it to something
like this:
<blockquote><pre>
alias XV "unu quantize -b 8 | unu save -f pnm | xv -"
</pre></blockquote>
In order to view images the data must be in 8 bit format for pnm
format or 8-16 bit for png format (although xv will quantize 16-bit
images to 8 bit anyway).
</p>

<p>Let's take a look at some data.  Using uda2nrrd I extracted a file
called temp_CC0050.nrrd.  You can <a
href="temp_CC0050.nrrd">download</a> it to follow along.</p>

<p>Use "<tt>unu head temp_CC0050.nrrd</tt>" to view the header.
<blockquote><pre>
NRRD0001
type: double
dimension: 3
sizes: 50 50 3
endian: little
encoding: raw
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>We only really need to care about the sizes of the dimensions for
now.  We can use the command unu slice to take a slice along any
dimension and view it in xv.

<blockquote><pre>
unu slice -p 1 -a 2 -i temp_CC0050.nrrd | XV
</pre></blockquote>
This is like making a 2D nrrd from data[][][1].  And should look
something like this<br /><img src="slice01.png" />
</p>

<p>Now this is kind of hard to see anthing interesting.  We have a
couple of optoins.  In xv we can press CTRL-c to view the comments to
the file.  This will tell use the min and max which was used in the
quantization.
<blockquote><pre>
NRRD>old min: 300
NRRD>old max: 19751.1
</pre></blockquote>
This tells us that there was more dynamic range than could be
expressed in 256 values.  We can do a histogram equalization to try
and see the changes in values easier.  We'll use the <tt>unu heq</tt>
command using 4000 bins for the quantization.  Smaller numbers will
work, but I haven't experimented much with different values.  heq has
other options which you can see by running <tt>unu heq</tt> with no
arguments.
<blockquote><pre>
unu slice -p 1 -a 2 -i temp_CC0050.nrrd | unu heq -b 4000 | XV
</pre></blockquote>
Still hard to see stuff as it is so little.<br /><img
src="slice01heq.png" />
</p>

<p>We can resize our image by using <tt>unu resample</tt>.  You can
specify the new size with -s followed by the new size of each
dimension delileated with spaces.  You can specify the exact size (-s
100 100) or by a multiplication factor using x (-s x10 x0.1).
</p>

<p>This uses convolution to produce the resized image.  Different
kernels will produce different types of interpolation.  For now there
is the default, tent (linear), and box (nearest neighbor).  You can
specify these with <tt>-k tent</tt>, <tt>-k box</tt>.  If you don't
want the data modified by the kernel use "=" for the size of that
dimension (useful for resizing color images where you don't the color
dimension mucked with).  Here are a few examples.</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Command</td><td>With heq</td><td>Without heq</td></tr>

<tr><td><tt>unu slice -p 1 -a 2 -i temp_CC0050.nrrd \<br />

| XV</tt></td>
<td><img src="slice01-resize03.png" /></td>
<td><img src="slice01-resize03-noheq.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Another option is to use a colormap.  unu can use colormaps that
come in the form of nrrds or text files.  You will want to quantize it
down to 8-bits before doing the colormapping.</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Command</td><td>With heq</td><td>Without heq</td></tr>

<tr><td><tt>unu slice -p 1 -a 2 -i temp_CC0050.nrrd \<br />

</tr>
</table>

<p>Here are some commands which you may find useful</p>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Graph a scan line of data</b> - You can use unu to take
slices of the data to give you a single scan line which you can either
view as the text values or pipe to a graphing program such as xmgr or
grace.  You can use Steve Parker's version of <a
href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Xmgr/">xmgr</a> on the SCI
side for SGI by using this command: <tt>alias xmgr
~sparker/bin/xmgr</tt>.  On linux you will have to download and
install <a href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/">Grace</a>.
The default installation path is /usr/local/grace/bin/xmgrace, which
you can alias to xmgr with this command: <tt>alias xmgr
'/usr/local/grace/bin/xmgrace -free'</tt> (the -free option will allow
xmgrace to resize the graph with the window size which is xmgr's
default)</p>

<table>
<tr><td><tt>
unu slice -p 1 -a 2 -i temp_CC0050.nrrd \<br />
| unu slice -a 1 -p 35 \<br />
| unu save -f text \<br />
| xmgr -pipe
</tt></td>
<td><img src="slice-xmgr.png" /></td></tr>
</table>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>SCIRun::Teem</h2>

<table border="1">
<tr><td valign="top">

<p>Alternatively you can use SCIRun to visualize your nrrd data.  Most
of the Uintah and SCIRun visualization modules use SCIRun::Fields as
input.  By enabling the Teem package you can read nrrd files and
convert them to SCIRun::Fields.
</p>

<p>You can enable the Teem package from any machine for which the
Thirdparty libraries have been built.  In fact you can get a copy of
unu from the Thirdparty bin directory.  Use <tt>--enable-package="Teem
Uintah"</tt> to get access to both Teem and Uintah visualization
tools.  Once you have configured and built your scirun binary you will
need two modules.  This example net loads in a nrrd and visualizes it
using texture cutting planes.  If you run scirun from the directory
you downloaded the data and net into, all you have to do is click
execute on any module to fire it up.</p>

<p>Here is an example net using texture cutting planes.  Click to
download the net.<br />
<a href="slice-vis.net"><img src="scirun.png" /></a></p>

<p>Here is an example net using isosurfaces colored by the isovalue.
Click to download the net.  Be sure to clidk autoview in the viewer as
the location of the view is not saved.<br />
<a href="iso-vis.net"><img src="scirun-iso.png" /></a></p>

</td>
<td valign="top">

<p>SCIRun nrrds have a notion of a tuple axis.  This facilitates items
such as vectors and matricies where a single axis is used as a data
item rather than a physical dimension.  For vector and matrix data the
first axis is the tuple axis.  For scalar data, make sure you check
the CreateNewTuple radio button
