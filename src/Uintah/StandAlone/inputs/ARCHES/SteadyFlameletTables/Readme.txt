Instructions for running mixing tables with flamelet reaction models
created by stand alone programs 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: The current capabilities are only to read tables generated by James
Sutherland (Adiabatic)

1. Make sure that you change the mixing model in the UPS file. A typical
   block looks like this

           <Properties>
                <denUnderrelax>1.00</denUnderrelax>
                <ref_point>[-1,-1,-1]</ref_point>
                <radiation>false</radiation>
                <filter_drhodt>true</filter_drhodt>
                <opl>6.0</opl>
                <mixing_model>SteadyFlameletsTable</mixing_model>
                <SteadyFlameletsTable>
                  <adiabatic>true</adiabatic>
                  <mixstatvars>1</mixstatvars>
                  <rxnvars>0</rxnvars>
                  <inputfile>beta.tbl</inputfile>
                </SteadyFlameletsTable>
            </Properties>

2. Put the mixing table in the runs directory with file name specified in
   the xml tag "<inputfile>"

3. The mixing tables and ups files are located in the sub-directories 
   from this level, named by fuel types
