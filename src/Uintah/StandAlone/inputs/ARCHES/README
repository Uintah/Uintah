Mostly all Arches runs, except for helium_1m.ups, require
different chemistry files along with input.dtd file to
be in the directory you run from, e.g.

UPS file name                   Chemistry file required

methane_explicit_table.ups      chem_bins/chem_meth.bin for SGI,
                                chem_bins/chem_meth.linux.bin for Linux

methane_1m.ups                  StaticMixingTables/Methane/nonadeqlb.tbl

heptane_1m.ups                  StaticMixingTables/Heptane/hept.rxn
