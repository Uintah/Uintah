  <title>Thirdparty Software Installation and Build Information</title>

  <sect1>
    <para>
      This chapter may help expedite installation of the
      required third party software. However, this information is not
      intended to replace the installation instructions that come with
      the software, but to supplement them. Please read the install
      instructions for each software distribution before attempting to
      use this information. 
    </para> 
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Prerequisites</title>
    <para>
      Use of this document requires experience with the SGI Irix 
      operating system and/or the Linux operating system. Knowledge of
      file systems, programming in C/C++, building software from
      tarball distributions and shell scripting will be useful, if not
      required. The installation or upgrade of core system components
      (such as the OS and compilers) may be required. As such, a
      system administrator's assistance may be warranted. 
    </para> 

    <para>
      This information does not apply to the installation and upgrade of
      the OS and build tools, as those topics are quite involved.
    </para>

    <title>Automatic Installation of All Thirdparty Software</title>
    
    <para>
      Because of many bugs and &quot;gotchas&quot; in the thirdparty
      installation process, the easiest and most dependable means of
      installation is the SCI Institute's thirdparty install
      script.
    </para> 
    
    <para>
      However, users may conduct a manual installation by following
      the instructions on this page starting at
      <ulink url="#4">Manual Installation of Required Thirdparty
      Software</ulink>. 
    </para> 

    <para>
      The automatic install script comes with all the necessary
      thirdparty software, and does not require additional
      downloads. 
    </para> 

    <para>
      To use the automatic install script do the following:

        <para>
          Unzip and untar the tar ball:
        </para>

        <computeroutput>
gunzip Thirdparty_install.x.x.x.tar.gz
tar xvf Thirdparty_install.x.x.x.tar

          Run the install script by typing:
        </emphasis></para>

        <computeroutput>
python install 32
        </computeroutput>

        <para>
          For 32 bit binaries and libraries, or
        </para>

        <computeroutput>
python install 64
        </computeroutput>

        <para>
          for 64 bit binaries and libraries.  64 bit is available for
          SGI only. 
        </para>

        <para>
          You can also specify a faster parallel build by giving an
          integer which provides the "number of jobs" argument for GNU make
          For example,to build 32 bit binaries and libraries using 12 jobs,
          type the following: 
        </para> 

        <computeroutput>
python install 32 12
        </computeroutput>

        <para>
          The install script will create a directory named
          SCIRun_Thirdparty_32 in the directory chosen in step 2
          above.  When it finishes, it will display a message
          regarding the --with-thirdparty SCIRun configure option.
          Cut and paste that option when running the configure command 
          for SCIRun (see step 2 of <ulink
          url="p1c2.html#5">Building SCIRun and Packages</ulink>). 
        </para>

        <para>
          The install script requires Python version 1.5 or greater

    <title>Manual Installation of Required Thirdparty Software</title>

     <sect2>
       <title>Recommended Build Tools</title>

       <para>
         You should use the same build tools to build the third party
         software as is required for building SCIRun itself.
       </para>
     </sect2>

     <sect2>
       <title>Recommended Installation Location</title>

       <para>
         SCIRun uses the latest versions of all the software that it
         requires, and can be configured to use those versions regardless
         of where that software is installed, whether it is all
         installed in the same location or not.  However, if the
         target install machine requires older versions of the same
         software (for other programs) then it is recommended that all
         the required third party software be installed into a
         centralized and out-of-the-way directory rather than in a
         directory already occupied by older versions of the third
         party software. 
       </para>

       <para>
         That said, if the target install machine only needs the
         latest versions of software, or if it doesn't matter one way
         or the other, then it is perfectly safe to install the
         required thirdparty software into any directory including
         directories where older versions are already installed.
       </para>

       <para>
         An example of a centralized and out-of-the-way location would be:
         /usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty_32 such that after installation
         the contents of that directory would look like this (assuming that
         the tarballs were unzipped and untarred in the /src directory inside
         /usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty_32):
       </para>
