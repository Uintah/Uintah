each of the other electrodes.  For each pairing, we build a right-hand-side column matrix 
that specifies the source-sink pair to have unit current.  That right-hand-side is passed
to a solve matrix module, the system is solved, the gradient is computed, and the ouput
is passed back to us and stored as one column in our lead-field matrix.
