<h3> Point Widget Help </h3>

The Point Widget consists of a sphere.  The primary use of the Point
Widget is for specifying the seedpoint of a single streamline.  It can
also be used for selecting a 3D coordinate for further operations, but
we recommend that the Crosshair Widget be used for that purpose.<p>

The user moves the Point Widget by dragging it.<p>
