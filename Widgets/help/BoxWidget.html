The Box Widget consists of twelve cylinders connected in a box
(3D rectangle) arrangement where the cylinders lie on the
edges of the box as shown in figure~\ref{fig:BoxDesign}.  In
the middle of each face of the box there is a sphere.  There
is a resize cylinder extending from each sphere.  The primary
use of the Box Widget is to select a subvolume of the
workspace for further manipulation (e.g. volume rendering,
isosurfaces, streamlines, FEM adaption) where the faces of the
widget act as orthogonal clipping planes.

If the user drags a sphere, the widget is rotated about its
center without changing the position of the center.  If a
resize handle is dragged, the appropriate face extends without
changing its orientation.  If a cylinder is dragged, the
entire widget moves without changing its orientation.
