<h3> Box Widget Help </h3>

The Box Widget consists of twelve cylinders connected in a box (3D
rectangle) arrangement where the cylinders lie on the edges of the
box.  In the middle of each face of the box there is a sphere.  There
is a resize cylinder extending from each sphere.  The primary use of
the Box Widget is to select a subvolume of the workspace for further
manipulation (e.g. volume rendering, isosurfaces, streamlines, FEM
adaption) where the faces of the widget act as orthogonal clipping
planes.<p>

If the user drags a sphere, the widget is rotated about its center
without changing the position of the center.  If a resize handle is
dragged, the appropriate face extends without changing its
orientation.  If a cylinder is dragged, the entire widget moves
without changing its orientation.<p>
