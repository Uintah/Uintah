This file contains the name of environmental variables that can be set

Set these like this:
 -> tcsh: setenv SCI_DEBUG ExecTimes:+
 -> bash: export SCI_DEBUG=ExecTimes:+

Name              type               Description
______________________________________________________________________

ExecTimes         SCI_DEBUG     outputs the time for execution on each task.
                                To view the top 10 tasks use:
                                sort -t: -k 2 -k 3 -g -r exectimes.?.? | head
                                To get a summary of all exectimes files run the script src/scripts/execsummary

ReductionTasks    SCI_DEBUG     outputs a message on processor 0 whenever a reduction task occurs.
RELOCATE_DBG      SCI_DEBUG     prints out debugging information in the code that finds the neighboring
                                patches inside of particle relocation task.
AMR               SCI_DEBUG     prints out the patch layout
TaskDBG           SCI_DEBUG     output the name of each task as it begins executing and when it's completed
TaskLevel         SCI_DEBUG     output the task name and beginning patch on each level after the 
                                task has completed.
TaskGraph         SCI_DEBUG     prints out computes and requires for every task
TaskGraphDetailed SCI_DEBUG     prints out internal details of computes and requires for every task
WaitForDebugger   SCI_DEBUG     when an exception is thrown halt the program and print out
                                the pid so you can attach a debugger to it.
OnDemandDataWarehouse           outputs when a variable is retrieved or put into the data warehouse.
VarLabel                        List when a VarLabel is created and deleted
ComponentTimings  SCI_DEBUG     output overall mpi and cpu times


Schedulers:                     NOTE: These will override the default "Unified Scheduler"
__________________________________
SingleProcessor   SCI_DEBUG     Use SingleProcessorScheduler
MPI               SCI_DEBUG     Use MPIScheduler - tasks are statically ordered
DynamicMPI        SCI_DEBUG     Use DynamicMPIScheduler - uses out-of-order task execution
ThreadedMPI       SCI_DEBUG     Use ThreadedMPIScheduler - Multi-threaded with centralized control thread
ThreadedMPI2      SCI_DEBUG     Use ThreadedMPI2Scheduler - Multi-threaded with no control thread
GPU               SCI_DEBUG     Multi-threaded with GPU support, centralized control thread


ICE:
__________________________________
ICE_DOING_COUT    SCI_DEBUG     Outputs the name of each task as it's being     
                                scheduled and executed.
ICE_BC_CC         SCI_DEBUG     output boundary condition debugging information for
                                Cell-centered variables.                         
ICE_BC_FC         SCI_DEBUG     output boundary condition debugging information for
                                Face-centered variables. 
DBG_EqPress       SCI_DEBUG     Output debugging information about the iteration
                                process in computeEquilibration if an exception is thrown.

ARCHES:

ARCHES_PRESS_SOLVE SCI_DEBUG    Outputs the name of each task in the pressure solveras it's being     
                                scheduled and executed.

MPM:
