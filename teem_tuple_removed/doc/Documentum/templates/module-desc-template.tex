%
% Notes:
%
% o Rename this file.  It should be named <module-name>.tex.
%
% o Complete mandatory sections below.
%
% o Use markup commands defined in scirun-doc.sty.
%   Avoid presentation markup (e.g. \textbf or \emph).
%
% o To make your document web-friendly, use commands from html package. See
%   latex2html manual or the book "The Latex Web Companion."
%
% o Don't use latex sectioning commands.  Use the commands
%   \ModuleRefSubSection{<title>} and \ModuleRefSubSubSection{<title>} to add
%   sub-sections and sub-sub-sections to the mandatory sections.
%
% o Add local commands if desired (via \newcommand).  But first check for
%   equivalent markup in scirun-doc.sty.
%
% o Only use packages distributed with Latex2e.
%
% o Cite references with the \cite command. Put citations in
%   a bib file and send along with this file.
%
% o Please include at least one image of your module's GUI. Provide 
%   either an JPG or GIF version.  Note that an EPS version is needed but
%   it will be generated automatically from the JPG or GIF figure when it
%   is needed. 
%
% o Including images:  Create a figure command for each figure using the
%   template below.  Copy the template (make a copy of the template
%   for each figure) and uncomment only the first '%' in each line.
%   Then replace angle-bracketed text with appropriate values.  Here is the
%   template: 
% 
%%begin{latexonly}
%  \newcommand{\<figure command name>}%
%  {\centerline{\includegraphics[options]{\ModuleRefFigName{<figure-name>.eps}}}}
%%end{latexonly}
%\begin{htmlonly}
%  \newcommand{\<figure command name (same as above)>}{%
%  \htmladdimg[options]{\ModuleRefFigName{<figure-name.jpg-or-gif>}}}
%\end{htmlonly}
%
%   Where in the ``latexonly'' part, ``options'' is a list of key-value pair
%   options.  Typically the options specify graphic width, height, and
%   bounding box.  See ``The Latex Graphics Companion'' for more
%   information.  Note that we are using ``\includegraphics'' command
%   from the ``graphicx'' package.
%
%   In the ``htmlonly'' part ``options'' is a list options such as ``align'',
%   ``width'', ``height'', and ``alt''.  See ``The Latex Web Companion'' for
%   details.
%
%   Where <figure-name>.eps and <figure-name.jpg-or-gif> should be
%   replaced by the names of your figures.
%   Note that figure names must be enclosed in the
%   \ModuleRefFigName command.
%   
%   Now to actually create figures enclose each figure command as follows:
%
%\begin{figure}
%  \begin{makeimage}
%  \end{makeimage}
%  \<figurecommand>
%  \caption{\label{fig:<figure label>} <Caption text>}
%\end{figure}
%
%   and replace bracketed text appropriately.
%   

% Uncomment the following block of commands and process with latex to see
% what your document will look like.  Also uncomment \end{document} command
% at the end of the file too.  Be sure to recomment these blocks when done!
