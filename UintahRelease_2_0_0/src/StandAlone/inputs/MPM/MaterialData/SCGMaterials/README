The include files found in this directory include an entire material definition 
including all material constants and a complete constitutive model based on the 
works of Daniel J. Steinberg, Stephen Cochran and Michael Guinan.  The parameters 
are taken from the LLNL report number URCL-MA-106439.  

A few things should be considered before using these material definitions.

1) Values were copied verbatim from the report where possible
2) Thermal conductivities were taken from Wikipedia.org on Feb. 18, 2012
3) For mixtures/alloys the thermal conductivity of the major constitutent was used
4) No parameters have been checked for physical validity
5) The Mie Gruneisen EOS used in the paper contained a volume dependence of the Gruneisen Gamma
that is not currently utilized in the Uintah Computational Framework, though the parameters have been included in the input files as comment lines
6) Several of the materials were presented with rate dependent parameters that have been excluded from these files
