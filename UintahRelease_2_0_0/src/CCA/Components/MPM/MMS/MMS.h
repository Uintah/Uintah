Member Functions :

initializeParticleForMMS : Initilaizes the Particle data at t = 0 ; Some MMS have intial velocity/displacement/stress. 
         For initial stress state, look at cnh_mms.cc 

computeExternalForceForMMS : Computes the analytically determined body force for the pre-determined deformation. 
           Look at the papers mentioned above for more information.
