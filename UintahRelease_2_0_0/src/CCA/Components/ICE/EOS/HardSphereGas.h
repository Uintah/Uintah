CLASS
   EquationOfState

   Hard sphere equation of state approximates the non-ideal properties of
   a real gas by accounting for a fixed volume of gas occupied by the 
   molecules themselves:

        RT
   P = -----   
        v-b

   P = pressure (Pa)
   R = gas constant = (gamma-1)*cv  (J/kg/K)
   gamma = heat capacity ratio = cp/cv (dimensionless) 
   cv = const volume specific heat (J/kg/K)
   cp = const pressure specific heat (J/kg/K)
   v = specific volume (m^3/kg)
   b = molecular volume (m^3/kg)
