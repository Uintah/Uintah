namespace Uintah {

  // This function is (indirectly) called by support programs (such as
  // puda, compare_uda, etc) when built in a static build.
  // (Specifically, called when the 1st DataArchive is created.)  This
  // function will cause all (most - some more types may need to be
  // listed if a problem is found) of our Uintah variable types to be
  // instantiated (and thus registered with the Uintah type system).
  // This normally happens (I think) for shared lib builds when the
  // CCVariable (etc) class is loaded (and static constructors fire).
  // However, for some (unknown) reason (perhaps the optimizer has
  // removed them?), this does not happen with static builds, and thus
  // when a tool (such as puda) goes to load a variable, the Uintah
  // type system throws an error because it doesn't know what type of
  // variables (eg: CCVariable) exist.
