    <summary>Make a new field with data at nodes instead of elements.</summary>
    <description>

      <p>MoveElemToNode creates a new field with the data at the mesh
      nodes rather than at the elements.  This currently only works on
      LatVolField, StructHexVolField, ImageField, and
      StuctQuadSurfField field types.  The data must be at cells/faces
      as appropriate to the field type.  A new field is created such
      that the data remains at the same positions in space but occupy
      the nodes of the new mesh rather than being located at the
      cell/face locations.  This is the opposite of
      <modref package="SCIRun" name="MoveNodeToElem"/>.</p>

<title>MoveElemToNode-img Regression Test</title>

<p>Test the MoveElemToNode module by moving the data in an ImageField
from the faces onto the nodes while retaining the same data locations.
The ImageField is transformed first so that the positions are better tested.</p>
