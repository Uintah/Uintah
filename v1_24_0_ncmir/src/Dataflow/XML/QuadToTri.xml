    <summary>Convert a QuadSurfField into a TriSurfField.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        Given a QuadSurfField (or anything that supports the same interface)
        as input, produce a TriSurfField as output -- each Quad element gets
        split into 2 Tris.  In order to produce consistent splits across
        faces, we alternate between two different templates for how to do
        the split.

<p>Use QuadToTri to convert an ImageField or QuadSurfField into a
TriSurfField.  The TriSurfField is then displayed in comparison with
the original field for verification that it was properly triangulated.</p>
