    <summary>Convert a combination of Nrrds to a SCIRun Field. This
    converter works on regular, unstructured and structured Data. If
    the module receives just Data, it will most likely be a regular Field
    (i.e. ScanLine, Image, LatVol).  For structured and unstructured
    Fields, the data is optional. If Points but no Connections are 
    given, a structured dataset will most likely be created
    (i.e. StructQuad, StructHex).  If Points and Connections 
    are given, an unstructured field will most likely be created
    (i.e. Curve, TriSurf, QuadSurf, TetVol, HexVol). If a Field is passed
    in, the module will try to use that Field's mesh.

    <p>Convert a combination of Nrrds to a SCIRun Field. This
    converter works on regular, unstructured and structured Data. If
    the module receives just Data, it will most likely be a regular Field
    (i.e. ScanLine, Image, LatVol).  For structured and unstructured
    Fields, the data is optional. If Points but no Connections are 
    given, a structured dataset will most likely be created
    (i.e. StructQuad, StructHex).  If Points and Connections 
    are given, an unstructured field will most likely be created
    (i.e. Curve, TriSurf, QuadSurf, TetVol, HexVol). If a Field is passed
    in, the module will try to use that Field's mesh.</p>
    <p>The first port is for Points.</p>
    <p>The second port should contain a Nrrd of connectivity.  This
    should be in the form P x N where P is the points in a connection
    and N is the number of connections.  For example, a TriSurf would
    have a connections nrrd that would be 3 x N.  The Unstructured
    Field will be determined based on the size of P.  A size of two
    will convert to a CurveMesh, a size of three will be a TriSurf,
    etc. In the case of P being equal to size 4, there is an ambiguity
    whether or not the resulting Field should be a TetVolField or
    QuadSurfField.  This can be indicated in the NrrdToField UI under
    the option Unstructured Cell Type when Points per Connection = 4.
    If Auto is selected, then the module will try to determine the
    Cell Type based on the Nrrd's Properties.  If it cannot be
    determined, a Cell Type of TetVolField. If the Points Nrrd happens
    to be in the form of N x P, the module will try to determine that
    and handle it accordingly.</p>
    <p>The third port is the Data port.  For the case of Regular data,
    this should be the only port connected. If it contains vector or
    tensor data values, they should be in the first axis and it's kind
    should be set accordingly.  This can be done with the <modref package="Teem" name="UnuAxinfo"/>
    module.</p>
    <p>The last port is the an optional Field input.  If this is
    connected, the module will attempt to use the Mesh from this Field
    for the new Field. If the input Field's Mesh does not match the
    information given in the other ports, it will default to the
    behavior above an disregard the incoming Field.</p>
    <p>The UI option Permute Data will permute Fortran data or data in
    the form (k,j,i).</p>
    <p>The UI option Build Eigen Decomposition for Tensor Field" will
    build the decomposition using a call to the Teem library
    (tenEigenSolve_f).</p>
    <p>The UI option of Structured/Unstructured Ambiguity is when the
    Data, or Points has a size of one in the first dimension.  This
    could be a Point Cloud or Struct Curve. If Auto is selected, the
    module will try to determine based on the Nrrd Property's Cell
    Type.  If it cannot be determined, the module will create a Point
    Cloud.  The UI settings will always over-ride the
    NrrdProperties.</p>
    <p>The list of Nrrd Names at the bottom of the UI is for
    information only.</p>
