### ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES SECTION ###
#####################################

# REMEMBER, if these variables are set in your shell environment, they will
# override the valuse in this file.

### SCIRUN_RCFILE_VERSION = [string]
#   The version number of this .scirunrc file.
#   Used in determining if the users existing.scirunrc 
#   needs to be updated upon starup of SCIRun.
SCIRUN_RCFILE_VERSION = 1.25.0.1


# The MALLOC_* environment variables can be set in order to help
# monitor and control the allocation of memory.  The environment
# variables are ONLY USED if DISABLE_SCI_MALLOC was NOT defined when
# SCIRun was configured.  If DISABLE_SCI_MALLOC is defined, then
# SCIRun will use the built in new, free, alloc, etc and will ignore
# the MALLOC_STRICT, MALLOC_LAZY, MALLOC_TRACE, and MALLOC_STATS variables.


### MALLOC_STRICT = [true if set]
#   Places markers in unused memory and uses them to
#   verify memory integrity.  Unless you wish to check memory integrity
#   explicitly using the "audit()" function, MALLOC_LAZY should NOT be set
# MALLOC_STRICT = false


### MALLOC_LAZY = [true if set]
#   By default, memory is audited for problems on each
#   allocation and deallocation.  If MALLOC_LAZY is set, then auditing
#   is turned off.  This can speed up code that allocates and
#   deallocates memory frequently.
# MALLOC_LAZY = false


### MALLOC_TRACE = [filename]
#   If MALLOC_TRACE is set, then every memory
#   allocation, reallocation, and deallocation will be logged.  If
#   "filename" is not provided, this information will be printed to "stderr".
# MALLOC_TRACE = trace.out


### MALLOC_STATS = [filename]
#   If MALLOC_STATS is set, when SCIRun exits,
#   it will output a list of statistics regarding memory usage during
#   the run.  This includes the number of alloc/free calls, the amount
#   of fragmentation, the amount of memory that is free and that is in
#   use, etc.  If "filename" is not provided, then "stderr" is used.

#   Path to use in searching for package .xml and .tcl files.
# SCIRUN_PACKAGE_SRC_PATH = /path/to/package/src


### SCIRUN_LOAD_PACKAGE = [comma-seperated list]
#   The format of SCIRUN_LOAD_PACKAGE is a comma seperated list of
#   package names.  This list specifies the package libraries to load
#   when SCIRun is first brought up.
# SCIRUN_LOAD_PACKAGE = BioPSE,Uintah,Teem


### SCIRUN_DATA = [path]
#   Directory location that 'Reader' modules will default to.
# SCIRUN_DATA = /usr/sci/data/SCIRunData/$(SCIRUN_VERISON)


### SCIRUN_DATASET = [name]
#   Name of data set in SCIRUN_DATA to default to.
# SCIRUN_DATASET = sphere


### SCIRUN_NET_SUBSTITUTE_DATADIR = [boolean]
#   If true, module filename variables will be automatically substituted for
#   'SCIRUN_DATADIR' and 'SCIRUN_DATASET' in saved .net files.
# SCIRUN_NET_SUBSTITUTE_DATADIR = false


### SCIRUN_MYDATA_DIR = [path]
#   Directory, or list of directories separated by colons, 
#   that data 'Reader' and 'Writer' modules will list as
#   optional paths in the directories drop down menu.
# SCIRUN_MYDATA_DIR = $HOME/data:/scratch/data


### SCIRUN_ON_THE_FLY_LIBS_DIR = [path]
#   User writable directory to build 'on-the-fly' .h, .cc, .o and .so files.
# SCIRUN_ON_THE_FLY_LIBS_DIR = $(HOME)/SCIRun/on-the-fly-libs


### SCIRUN_FONT_PATH = [path]
#   The directory in which scirun.ttf (default font) resides.
SCIRUN_FONT_PATH = $(SCIRUN_SRCDIR)/pixmaps


### SCIRUN_TMP_DIR = [path]
#   Directory for writting temporary files - must be world read/writeable
SCIRUN_TMP_DIR = /tmp

### SCIRUN_SERV_TMP_DIR = [path]
#   Directory for writting temporary files - must be world read/writeable
#   This is one is used by the external application interface. Both scirun
#   and scirunremote use this one to exchange files.
SCIRUN_SERV_TMP_DIR = /tmp


### SCI_DBXCOMMAND = [command]
#   Command to run when SCIRun dies and the user chooses to run a debugger
# SCI_DBXCOMMAND = "dbx"


### SCI_EXCEPTIONMODE = <ask, throw, dbx, cvd, abort>
# Default action to take if scirun crashes
# SCI_EXCEPTIONMODE = ask


### SCI_SIGNALMODE = <ask, ???, ???, ???>
#   Action to take when a signal interrupts scirun.
# SCI_SIGNALMODE = ask


### SCIRUN_CONFIRM_OVERWRITE = [boolean]
#   If false, SCIRun writer will not prompt the user before overwriting a file
# SCIRUN_CONFIRM_OVERWRITE = true


### SCIRUN_INSERT_NET_COPYRIGHT = [boolean]
#   If true, adds SCI copyright to any SCI .net files that are created.
# SCIRUN_INSERT_NET_COPYRIGHT = false


### SCIRUN_NOCLEANUPCOMPILE = [boolean]
#   If true, the dynamic compiler will not clean up bad code compiles.
#   Useful for debugging dynamic compilation code.
# SCIRUN_NOCLEANUPCOMPILE = true


### SCIRUN_NOSPLASH = [boolean]
#   If true, SCIRun will not display the splash screen at startup.
# SCIRUN_NOSPLASH = false


### SCIRUN_HIDE_PROGRESS = [boolean]
#   If true, SCIRun will not display progress bars during startup and loading
# SCIRUN_HIDE_PROGRESS = false


### SCIRUN_FAST_QUIT = [boolean]
#   If true, SCIRun will not ask the user to save a network before quitting
# SCIRUN_FAST_QUIT = false


### SCI_NPROCESSORS = [integer]
#   On SGIs, override the system setting for number of processors on a machine
# SCI_NPROCESSORS = 1


### SCI_REGRESSION_TESTING = [boolean]
#   If True, regression testing mode will turn on.  Execution starts after a
#   network is loaded and SCIRun will exit immediately after creating an image.
# SCI_REGRESSION_TESTING = false


### SCIRUN_REGRESSION_TESTING_TIMEOUT = [integer]
#   If set, and if SCI_REGRESSION_TESTING is True, SCIRun will automatically
#   kill itself after specified seconds.

#   initialization of the thread library.
# THREAD_SHOWINIT = true


### FLIP_CAM_MANIP = [boolean]
#   Flips the XY values of the render window. (Not 100% sure on this one...)
# FLIP_CAM_MANIP = false


### SCIRUN_NO_PORT_CACHING = [boolean]
#   If true then SCIRun will no longer cache intermediate results in
#   its ports.  This will break interactive SCIRun usage as the
#   program will be confused about which modules it needs to reexecute
#   when a network is changed.  However it can save memory usage for
#   batch-type operation.  Smarter caching should deprecate this option
#   in the future.
# SCIRUN_NO_PORT_CACHING = false


### SCIRUN_DRAWARRAYS_DISABLE = [boolean]
#   Turns off use of glDrawArrays.  This should be set to true if you wish
#   to avoid drawing artifacts on _ATI_ Radeon cards under Linux or to fix
#   cross-platform remote display problems.
# SCIRUN_DRAWARRAYS_DISABLE = false


### SCIRUN_DISABLE_PBUFFERS = [boolean]
#   Turns off the use of pbuffers even if they are supported by the
#   platform.  pbuffers are used to save images from the viewer and
#   for some background tasks related to volume rendering.  However on
#   Linux with ATI they seem to have OpenGL state issues in that
#   transparency is disabled and volume rendering can lock up the
#   screen.
# SCIRUN_DISABLE_PBUFFERS = false


### SCIRUN_MPEG_LICENSE_ACCEPT = [boolean]
#   License information describing the mpeg_encode software can be found
#   in SCIRun's Thirdparty directory, in the mpeg_encode/README file:
#   This software is freely distributed.  That means, you may use it
#   for any non-commercial purpose.  However, patents are held by
#   several companies on various aspects of the MPEG video standard.

#   If you are allowed to use the MPEG functionality based on the above
#   license, you may
#   enable MPEG movie recording in SCIRun (accessible via the SCIRun
#   Viewer's "File->Record Movie" menu) by setting the value of
#   SCIRUN_MPEG_LICENSE_ACCEPT to "true".
# SCIRUN_MPEG_LICENSE_ACCEPT = false
