    <summary>The RawtoDenseMatrix mdoule reads CVRTI potentials, with output as a DenseMatrix.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>The input data comes from CVRTI (Cardiovascular Research and Training Institute) formatted .pots file.  
The output is a
DenseMatrix, arranged with each lead in the rows, and each column as a time
instance. The UI sets the start, end, and units for the time steps.</p>
