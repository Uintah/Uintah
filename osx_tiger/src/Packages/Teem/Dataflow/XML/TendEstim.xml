    <summary>Estimate tensors from a set of DW images. </summary>
    <description>
      <p>Estimate tensors from a set of DW images. The various DWI volumes
must be stacked along axis 0 (as with the output of "tend epireg"). The tensor
coefficient weightings associated with each of the DWIs, the B-matrix, is
given as a seperate array, see "tend bmat" usage info for details. A
"confidence" value is computed with the tensor, based on a soft thresholding
of the sum of all the DWIs, according to the threshold and softness parameters.</p>
      <p>B0 is stored as first DWI value : Determines if the B=0 non-diffusion-weighted reference
      image is known, or if it has to be estimated along with
      the tensor elements. Check it if true to indicate that the B=0 image is the FIRST input image
      given , and hence the B-matrix has ONE LESS row
      than the number of of input images. If false, there is no reference image; all the
      input images are diffusion-weighted in some way or
      another, and there exactly as many rows in the B-matrix
      as there are input images</p>
      <p>Threshold : </p>
      <p>Soft : how fuzzy the confidence boundary should be. By default,
      confidence boundary is perfectly sharp. This value should be a float.</p>
      <p>Scale : After estimating the tensor, scale all of its elements
      (but not the confidence value) by this amount. Can help
      with downstream numerical precision if values are very
      large or small. This value should be a float.</p>
