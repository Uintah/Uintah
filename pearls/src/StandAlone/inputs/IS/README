JP8_IS.ups
---------------------------------------
A modified version of the ../Models/JP8Fire_container.ups file.  
	- Set the boundry conditions in the grid variables section for 3D
	- Set level in the grid variables section for 3D
	- Changed the output name to JP8_IS.uda
	- Added p.volume to the list of saved properties
	- Set the ICE settings dyanmic_viscosity and thermal_conductivity to 0

6/13/05 Modification by Jim Guilkey
	- Increase the frequency of checkpointing
	- Put in the ability to use the material addition, namely for
the product of reaction material.  The only caveat with this involves
doing a restart AFTER the explicit phase of the calculation has begun.
If it is necessary to do that, the user should:
	1.  Move the material info from MaterialProperties add=true /ICE up to
where the other ICE materials are defined.
	2.  Move the exchange_properties from the MaterialProperties add=true
section up to the main MaterialProperties section
	3.  Switch CanAddIceMaterial back to false
	4.  In the SimpleBurn model, change Active to true

	- Note that if the above 4 steps aren't taken, then upon restart, the
contribution from the previous products of reaction are lost, and the PBX
reaction starts over again as if starting for the first time.


ContainerHeatUp3D.ups
---------------------------------------
This input file is similar to the IS, but it is set up to do the slow heatup
part of the calculation.  Run it with sus -impm ContainerHeatUp3D.ups
As of 6/15/05, thermal expansion of the steel is implemented, but not yet
in the PBX.  Note also that for now, the top half of the domain has been
lopped off as there isn't anything interesting there, so that would kill
our load balancing.
