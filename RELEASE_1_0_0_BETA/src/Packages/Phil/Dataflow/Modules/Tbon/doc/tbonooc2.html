<h1>TBONOOC2</h1>

<b>Description:</b><p>

<a href="template.html">Template class</a> (Please read!)<p>

Implementation of another out-of-core algorithm based on the Temporal
Branch-on-Need Octree (T-BON) for rectilinear scalar fields.<p>

Some preprocessing must be done before isosurface extraction.
This preprocessing is DIFFERENT from that of the 
<a href="tbon.html">TBON</a> and
<a href="tbonooc1.html">TBONOOC1</a> modules - don't just use the files
resulting from those preprocess.  Your results will be incorrect.
<p>

During execution (run the module on an execution metafile), the
user controls isovalue and time value sliders.  Nodes and data are read
in whenever needed to construct the current isosurface, otherwise
left on disk.  Nodes and data are read in in blocks to improve I/O
performance (again, see the thesis).  A static data structure holds
the nodes, while a dynamic data structure is
used to hold data blocks (see algorithm 2 in the thesis).
A Marching Cubes-type 
interpolation is performed to create triangles for rendering.<p>

The maximum size for the dynamic data structure that holds the data
bricks is declared statically in TbonOOC2.cc:<p>

<pre>
static const int DATABRICKS = &lt size of data list &gt;
</pre><p>

The <b>minimum</b> size is <b>8</b>.<p>


<p><b>Metafile format:</b><p>

Although the results of preprocessing are not the same, the metafile
format for TBONOOC2 is the same as that of the <a href="tbon.html">
TBON</a> module.<p>
