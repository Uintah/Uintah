The include files found in this directory include a Mie Gruneisen equation of state
based on the works of Daniel J. Steinberg, Stephen Cochran and Michael Guinan.  The 
parameters are taken from the LLNL report number URCL-MA-106439.  

One thing should be considered before using these material definitions:

The Mie Gruneisen EOS used in the paper contained a volume dependence of the Gruneisen Gamma
that is not currently utilized in the Uintah Computational Framework, though the parameters have been included in the input files as comment lines
