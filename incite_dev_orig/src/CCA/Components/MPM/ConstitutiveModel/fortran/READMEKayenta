In order to use the Kayenta GeoModel with Uintah, you will need to
do the following:

1.  Access the Kayenta, aka GeoModel, source code.  See Jim Guilkey
or Rebecca Brannon for more information on this.

2.  In the /toolset directory, do:

createKayentaRelease

Which will create a KAYENTA_FILES directory with the source code (or just the libraries):
/materials/kayenta/branches/current-releases/f77-isotropic-uintah
/materials/kayenta/branches/current-releases/f77-isotropic-uintah-lib

3.  From the directory you are currently in
(Uintah/CCA/Components/MPM/ConstitutiveModel/fortran), do the following:

cp KAYENTA_FILES/*.* .

At this point, you should be able to recompile the sus executable, after
which you will be ready to run simulations using Kayenta.
