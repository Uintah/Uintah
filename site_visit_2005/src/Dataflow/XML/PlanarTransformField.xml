    <summary>Non-interactive geometric transform of a field.</summary>
    <description>

      <p>This module is used to non-interactively transform the
      geometry of a field.  The transform is passed in to the
      "Transform Matrix" port as a 4x4 matrix.  There is no GUI for
      this module.  The transform is
      generally computed by a different module, such as
      <modref package="SCIRun" name="BuildTransform"/>.  For interactive geometry transforms use the
      <modref package="SCIRun" name="ChangeFieldBounds"/> module.</p>
