    Function makeGrid: 
    Harmonic average of the diffusion coefficient.
    A = harmonicAvg(X,Y,Z) returns the harmonic average of the
    diffusion coefficient a(T) (T in R^D) along the line connecting
    the points X,Y in R^D. That is, A = 1/(integral_0^1
    1/a(t1(s),...,tD(s)) ds), where td(s) = x{d} + s*(y{d} -
    x{d})/norm(y-x) is the arclength parameterization of the
    d-coordinate of the line x-y, d = 1...D.  We assume that A is
    piecewise constant with jump at Z (X,Y are normally cell centers
    and Z at the cell face). X,Y,Z are Dx1 location arrays.  In
    general, A can be analytically computed for the specific cases we
    consider; in general, use some simple quadrature formula for A
    from discrete a-values. This can be implemented by the derived
    test cases from Param.

    ### NOTE: ### If we use a different
    refinement ratio in different dimensions, near the interface we
    may need to compute A along lines X-Y that cross more than one
    cell boundary. This is currently ignored and we assume all lines
    cut one cell interface only.
