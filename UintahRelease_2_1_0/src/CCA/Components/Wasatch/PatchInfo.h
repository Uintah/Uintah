   *  \brief Holds a pointer to a Uintah::Patch. The intention of this structure is to allow expressions
   to access Uintah patches internally through the bind_operators callback. This structure is
   to be registered in an operators database using:
   (given a: const Uintah::Patch* const patch)
   register_new_operator<UintahPatchContainer>( scinew UintahPatchContainer(patch) )
   Then, for expressions that require access to a patch, declare a private member
   UintahPatchContainer* patchContainer_
   and then in bind_operators use:
   patchContainer_ = opdb.retrive_operator<UintahPatchContainer>()
   Finally, patch access is performed via:
   const Uintah::Patch* const patch_ = patchContainer_->get_uintah_patch();
