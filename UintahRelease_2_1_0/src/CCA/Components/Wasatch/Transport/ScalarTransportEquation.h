   *  \date July, 2011. (Originally Created: June 2010).
   *
   *  \brief Support for a generic scalar transport equation.
   *
   *  Sets up solution for a transport equation of the general form of:
   *
   *  \f[
   *    \frac{\partial \rho \phi}{\partial t} =
   *    - \nabla\cdot\rho\phi\vec{u}
   *    - \nabla\cdot\vec{J}_\phi
   *    + s_\phi
   *  \f]
   *
   *  Any or all of the terms in the RHS above may be activated
   *  through the input file. Also, it can be define in input file
   *  whether we have a constant or variable density and strong or
   *  weak form of this equation.
   *
   *  The other supported forms of the equation are:
   *
   *  - Constant density and variable density weak form:
   *  \f[
   *    \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} =
   *     \frac{1}{\rho}\left[
   *     - \phi \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}
   *     - \nabla\cdot\rho\phi\vec{u}
   *     - \nabla\cdot\vec{J}_\phi
   *     + s_\phi
   *    \right]
   *  \f]
   *   Note that in this form, \f$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}\f$ is retained
   *   and the strong form of the convective flux is also retained.  The model
   *   for \f$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}\f$ being used in the pressure
   *   Poisson equation is used here.
   *
   *  \par Notes & Restrictions
   *
   *  - In the above equations, the diffusive flux is assumed to have the form
   *    \f[ \vec{J}_\phi = -\rho \Gamma_\phi \nabla \phi. \f]
   *    This can also be written in terms of a diffusive velocity,
   *    \f[ \vec{V}_\phi = \frac{\vec{J}}{\rho}. \f]
   *    The user must provide an expression or a constant value for
   *    \f$\Gamma_\phi\f$.  See the DiffusiveFlux and DiffusiveFlux2 classes
   *    for further details.
   *
   *  - Source terms, \f$s_\phi\f$, can only be added if the expression to
   *    evaluate them has been constructed elsewhere.
   *
   *  - When solving constant density or weak forms of the scalar transport
   *    equation, the source term(s) must be divided by \f$\rho\f$.  This is
   *    handled for all source terms that this transport equation is made aware
   *    of at construction.  However, if source terms are added to the RHS then
   *    they need to be scaled by density in the case where the weak or constant
   *    density form of the equation is being solved!  This is NOT done
   *    automatically.
