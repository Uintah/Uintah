  \class BoundCondReader
        
  \brief Reads in the boundary conditions and stores them for later processing
  by Patch.cc.
        
  Reads in the boundary conditions for a given face and a given material.
  Multiple material bc specifications may be combined within a single 
  \<Face\> \</Face\>.

  The boundary condition specification consist of two components, a 
  geometrical component and a type-value pair component.  The geometrical 
  component describes where on a patch's face the boundary condition is
  applied.  The side specification will apply the bc's type-value pair to
  the entire face.  The circle specification will apply the bc to a circular
  region on a face.  The rectangle specification will apply the bc to a
  rectangular region on a face.  There may be multiple specifications of 
  circles and rectangles on a give face.  There must be at least one side
  specification for each face.  The type-value pair component are described 
  in the BoundCondBase class.

  A significant component of the BoundCondReader class is to take the 
  geometrical specification and arrange the various instances of side,
  circle, and rectangle in such a manner as to ensure that the entire face
  has an bc value specified.  To accomplish this, auxillary classes 
  UnionBCData, and DifferenceBCData are used to manage the union of multiple
  instances of rectangle and circle bcs for a given side and the difference
  of that collection with the base side bc.  Unions and difference bcs are 
  not available to the user.

  Currently, this class supports the old way of specifying the geometric
  component and the new way.  The old way only allowed a side specification.
  The new way allows for circles, rectangles and a side specification 
  for a given face.  At some point, the old way infrastructure will be go 
  away.

     \brief   Creates interior boundaries. Currently supported geometries are: rectangle, circle,
     ellipse, and annulus.
     
     For a given grid resolution, the interior boundary is moved to the closest face. If the interior
     boundary coincides with a cell center, then it is moved to the face side (minus/plus) that is 
     specified through the input file. The face side (minus/plus) determines which cell iterator is
     returned. For a minus boundary, the cells on the minus side are returned. For a plus boundary,
     the cells on the plus side are returned.
