  /**
   *  \brief Function that parses the current location of an ifstream input file 
  for a value. The values are assumed to be separated by a space, comma (,), or
   semi colon (;). This function will skip all commented lines, i.e. those lines
   starting with #, %, //, and C-style comments. As an example, assume that your input file looks
   like the following:
   \verbatim
   # my input file
   # dimensions
   10 12 14
   # face direction
   x-
   # values
   1.34 2.55 6.42
   ...
   # end of my input file
   \endverbatim
   
   Then, to parse this input file, you can do the following:
   
   \code{.cpp}
   std::ifstream ifs( inputFileName.c_str() );
   int nx, ny, nz
   getValue(ifs, nx); // nx = 10
   getValue(ifs, ny); // ny = 12
   getValue(ifs, nz); // nz = 14
   
   std::string faceDir;
   getValue(ifs, faceDir); // faceDir = x-
   
   double u, v, w;
   for (int i=0; i<imax; i++) {
     getValue(ifs,u);
     getValue(ifs,v);
     getValue(ifs,w);
     // do something with u, v, and w...
   }
   \endcode
   
   This function is templated on the datatype of the parameter "value".
   *
   *  \param inputFStream A reference to the input file stream that is being parsed.
   *
   *  \param value A reference to the variable that is being filled.
