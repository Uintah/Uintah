        <p>Welcome to the SCIRun primer.  This tutorial is an interactive introduction to SCIRun for             
        new users.  Since
        SCIRun is a  large system, this tutorial provides a broad
        overview of SCIRun concepts, and a core set of SCIRun user
        skills.  There are seven chapters in this document. By the end of the tutorial, the user will have 
        a grasp of dataflow programming, SCIRun architecture, and the
        specific modules and datatypes used along the way.

	<p> Please take time working through the tutorial.
        If you have questions at any time, email the
        scirun-users@sci.utah.edu list for assistance. Notice
        that hyperlinks exist thoughout this document, each of which points to more comprehensive 
        descriptions about each subject.

        <p>The tutorial begins with Chapter 1,
        which demonstrates the construction of a simple, yet functional SCIRun network.
       This demonstration is extended in Chapters 2-7, with additional functionality
        and complexity.
