CLASS
   UnionGeometryPiece
	
   Creates a collection of geometry pieces from the xml input 
   file description.

KEYWORDS
   UnionGeometryPiece BoundingBox inside
	
DESCRIPTION
   Creates a union of different geometry pieces from the xml input 
   file description.
   Requires multiple inputs: specify multiple geometry pieces.  
   There are methods for checking if a point is inside the union of 
   pieces and also for determining the bounding box for the collection.
   The input form looks like this:
       <union>
         <box>
	   <min>[0.,0.,0.]</min>
	   <max>[1.,1.,1.]</max>
	 </box>
	 <sphere>
	   <origin>[.5,.5,.5]</origin>
	   <radius>1.5</radius>
	 </sphere>
       </union>
