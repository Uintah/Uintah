      <p>
The HDF5 Field Reader module reads a HDF5 file containing data. The
reader will read simple and scalar data. Compound data is not read at
this time. The user first selects the file through the browser. Files
with a suffix h5 will be displayed.
</p>
<p>
Once the file has been read the contents will be displayed in the File
Treeview. The user may scroll through the contents using the arrows
keys or by using left mouse clicks on the to open the folders. Only
HDF5 groups, attributes, and dataset nodes are displayed in the
treeview. For attribute and dataset nodes their node type, data type,
and value are displayed in the Type and Value columns,
respectufully. In the case of the attrbiutes the data values are
displayed. For datasets the data type and the value of the dimensions
of the dataset are displayed. 
</p>
<p>
A single dataset may be selected using a left mouse click. When a
dataset has been selected it with be highlighted in white and listed
in the Selected Data listbox. The dataset can be deselected using a
left mouse click as well. Multiple datasets may be selected using
the ctrl and shift left mouse clicks. If a group is selected all
chilren will be selected. Attrbiutes can not be selected and are only
provided as suplementary information. 
</p>
<p>
Exact and regular expression searches for data can be used to select
the data based on the node's full path name or its terminal name. When
searchiing the full path a space is used as a separator between the
parent and child name. For example, "/ parent child grandchild". If
the name contains brackets [] the name must be surrounded by braces
{}. For example, {data[0]} 
</p>
<p>
When using a regular expression two strings will match when their
contents are identical except that the following special sequences may
appear in pattern: 
</p>
<p>
    *   Matches any sequence of characters in string, including a null string. 
</p>
<p>
    ?   Matches any single character in string. 
</p>
<p>
    [chars]   Matches any character in the set given by chars. If a
              sequence of the form x-y appears in chars, then any character
              between x and y, inclusive, will match.
</p>
<p>
    \x  Matches the single character x. This provides a way of
        avoiding the special interpretation of the characters *?[]\ in 
        the pattern.
</p>
<p>
Once the data has been selected its name will appear in the "Selected
Data" listbox. A data set can be deselected by selecting it in the
listbox and pressing the "Delete Selection" button.
</p>
<p>
When reading the data it is possible to select a hyperslab or subset
of the data using the sliders. 
</p>
<p>
Once the data has been read it can be merged into one output NRRD if
it has the same dimensionality and data type. When the data is merged
a new "Time" axis will be constructed. The time axis represents the
number datasets merged together. Combining datasets is necessasry when
using the NrrdSelectTime to animating data.  If the data is not merged
dataset will be outputed individually. The maximum outputs is six. 
</p>
<p>
The "Assume Vector-Tensor data" will convert datasets that have the
last dimension of either 3 or 6 into SCIRun "Vectors" or "Tensors".
This is needed for animating mutliple datasets when using the
NrrdSelectTime. If it is not selected data will be assumed to be
"Scalar"
