    <summary>Form adjecency matrix of connected components. This operates on
the output of ccfind. Output is unsigned char array containing 1 at
locations (I,J) and (J,I) if CCs with ids I and J are adjacent, according to
the chosen style of adjacency.</summary>

    <p>Connectivity : indicates what kind of connectivity to use, or
     the number of coordinates that vary in order to traverse the
     neighborhood of a given sample. In 2D: 1: 4-connected,
     2: 8-connected. This value should be represented by an integer.</p>
