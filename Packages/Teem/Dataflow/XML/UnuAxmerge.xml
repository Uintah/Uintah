    <p>Merge two adjacent axes into one. A more general version of unu
axdelete. The underlying linear ordering of the samples is unchanged, and the
information about the other axes is shifted downwards as needed.</p>
    <p>Axis: One or more integers separated by white space.  Each axis 
    index identified is the lower of the pair of axes that will be 
    merged. Saying -a 2 means to merge axis 2 and axis 3 into axis 2. 
    If multiple merges are to be done, the indices listed here are for the axes
    prior to any merging.</p>
