    <summary>Cheap histogram-based median filtering</summary>
    <description>
      <p>Cheap histogram-based median filtering. Only works on 1, 2,
or 3 dimensions. The window over which filtering is done is always
square, and only a simplistic weighting scheme is available. The
filtering works by forming a histogram of the values in the window,
and updating it as the window slides through the volume. Because of
this histogramming, precision will be lost on anything other than
8-bit data (assuming a sane # bins "-b"). Also, this is "cheap"
because it doesn't do any filtering on the border (as defined by
radius "-r"); values at these locations are simply copied from input.
