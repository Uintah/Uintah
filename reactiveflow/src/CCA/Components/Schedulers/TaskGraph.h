CLASS
   TaskGraph
   
   During the TaskGraph compilation, the task graph does its work in
   the createDetailedTasks function.  The first portion is to sort the tasks,
   by adding edges between computing tasks and requiring tasks,
   and the second is to create detailed tasks and dependencies

   Here is a function call tree for this phase:
   createDetailedTasks
     nullsort (formerly was topologicalSort)
       setupTaskConnections
         addDependencyEdges
       processTask
         processDependencies
     LoadBalancer::createNeighborhood (this stores the patches that border
                                       patches on the current processor)

   Detailed Task portion: divides up tasks into smaller pieces, and sets up the
   data that need to be communicated between processors when the taskgraph executes.

     createDetailedTask (for each task, patch subset, matl subset)

     createDetailedDependencies (public)
       remembercomps
       createDetailedDependencies (private)
         DetailedTasks::possiblyCreateDependency or Task::addInternalDependency

   Then at the and:
     DetailedTasks::computeLocalTasks
