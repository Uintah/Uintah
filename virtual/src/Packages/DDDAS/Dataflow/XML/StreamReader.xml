    <summary>Connect and collect streaming data.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>Connects to a remote host, receives streaming data and
processes the data.  Currently this streamed data comes in several
formats and is intended to simulate sensor data.</p>
      <p>For the stream 2 spec, a point cloud mesh is built from the
scalar values and coordinates sent across the stream.</p>
      <p>The stream 3 spec has not yet been tested, but there is some
code in place to be used as a starting point.</p>
      <p>The places where code needs to be modified to accommodate new
stream data formats is indicated with '==>'.</p>
