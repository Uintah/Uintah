          the one-dimensional shocktube problem,
          mid-2004.
ShockTube1D - Oren's modified 1D shock tube simulation of ICE,
          building on Todd's code and adding some printouts, bug
          corrections, etc,
          October 2004 - May 2005.
SolverBug - matlab scripts and data files comparing the Uintah and
          Hypre matrices in implicit ICE (one level, not AMR),
