\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

This is the \etitle{\srug}.  It describes the purpose and use of the
\sr{} problem solving environment (\pse).  This guide is for users who
are building and executing \dfn{networks} within the \sr{}
environment.

Users installing \sr{} should read the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{\srig}{\htmlurl{\latexhtml{\scisoftware/doc}{../../..}/Installation/Guide/ch.inst.html}}.

Users of the BioTensor Power App should see the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{BioTensor
  tutorial}{\latexhtml{http://software.sci.utah.edu/doc/User/Tutorials/BioTensor/BioTensor.html}{../../Tutorials/BioTensor/BioTensor.html}}.

\section{Help}
\label{sec:help}

Help is available from the following sources.

\subsection{Documentation Distribution}

\sr{} documentation is distributed separately from its source code.
\sr{}'s documentation distribution can be downloaded from
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{\sr{}'s software download
  page}{\scisoftwarearchiveurl}.  See the 
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{\srig}{\htmlurl{\latexhtml{\scisoftware/doc}{../../..}/Installation/Guide/ch.inst.html}}
for instructions on downloading and installing the documentation
distribution.

After installing the documentation, point the browser at the
\filename{index.html} file located in the distribution's top level
\directory{doc} directory (\ie{} \ab{top of documentation
  distribution}/doc/index.html).

\subsection{The Web}

This and other documents related to \sr{} can be found 
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{online}{\scidocurl{}}.

Visit the \sci{} web site for more
information related to \sr{} and the \scii{}.

\subsection{Mailing Lists}

The \sr{} \emph{users} mail list is a forum for discussing \sr{}
related issues.  To subscribe send mail to:

\mailto{Majordomo@sci.utah.edu}

with the following command in the body of the message:

\keyboard{subscribe scirun-users}

After subscribing,  questions can be sent to
\mailto{scirun-users@sci.utah.edu}.

The \sr{} \emph{developers} list is a forum for network and module
developers.  To subscribe send mail to:

\mailto{Majordomo@sci.utah.edu}

with the following command in the body of the message:

\keyboard{subscribe scirun-develop}

After subscribing, questions can be sent to
\mailto{scirun-develop@sci.utah.edu}.

\section{Reporting Bugs}
\label{sec:bugs}

Please report bugs!  To report a bug visit \sr{}'s
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{bug database}{\bugsurl} web page.

Reporting bugs to the bug database, rather than the mailing list,  ensures
bugs are fixed in a timely manner.
