    <p>
      Dataflow/Widgets contains a set of 3D interaction widgets.
      These widgets have a graphical representation within the scene
      graph of the Viewer, and can be directly manipulated within a
      visualization.  Furthermore, the module that creates a widget
      maintains access to and control of the widget, and is alerted
      through a callback when a widget is manipulated within a scence.
      Through this callback mechanism, the module can respond
      appropriately as the widget interaction is taking place -
      thereby allowing compuational feedback to be directly coupled
      with the visual feedback.

    <!-- Discuss why a developer would need or want to use the
         functions and/or classes in this directory. -->
      <p>
        Widgets are useful in any context where direct manipulation
        has clear advantages over indirect manipulation.  For example,
        when specifying a cutting plane for a scene, it is possible to
        specify that plane by entering the A, B, C, and D of a plane
        equation (Ax + By + Cz + D = 0) with sliders or text-entry
        boxes; however, it is often much more natural to place a
        graphical representation of that plane (for example, a
        rectangular frame widget) into the scene and provide the user
        handles to translate and rotate the clipping plane directly.
        By manipulating the object directly, a greater sense of
        immersion is obtained, and the user has a more natural
        mechanism for setting parameters.
      </p>
    </why>
    <when>
    <!-- Discuss when or where to use the functions and classes in
         this directory: From within modules?, when a certain event
	 occurs? -->
      <p>
        Widgets should be constructed within the module that will be
        using them, and should be sent to a Viewer module through a
        Geom outport.  The developer should implement the virtual
        get_pick() method for their module if they want catch the
        callbacks when the widget is manipulated.
