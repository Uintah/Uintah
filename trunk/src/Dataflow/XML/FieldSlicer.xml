The Field Slicer module reduces the dimension of a topologically
regular field by 1 dimension.
      </p>

<p> The Field Slicer input port is a field that has regular topology.
The field will be reduced by 1 dimension and piped to the output
port. The user must supply two input values via the module GUI, the
axis the field is reduced along and location along the selected
axis. </p>

<title>FieldSlicer Regression Test</title>

<p>Read in the utah torso model and display it's boundary for reference.
Then resample the model using the SampleLattice module to fit it to a
regular grid which is then visualized as a point cloud.  Finally the
FieldSlicer module is used to select an arbitrary plane from the
sampled lattice.  This plane is then drawn using larger dots and
compared with the underlying mesh to determine that it was selected
correctly.</p>

<p>This network can be found at src/nets/Modules/FieldsCreate/FieldSlicer.net.</p>

<title>FieldSlicer-testimgi Regression Test</title>

<p>Create a sample field, populate it with a nice synthetic data set, and
move it to an arbitrary non-identity transformation in space.  Then
FieldSlicer is used to extract a particular plane or scanline from the
field and the result is visualized for comparison purposes.</p>
