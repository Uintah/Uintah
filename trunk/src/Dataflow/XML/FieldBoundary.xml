    <summary>The FieldBoundary module extracts a boundary surface from a volume field.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        The FieldBoundary module extracts the bounding surface of
        the incoming field, making it into a new field that it outputs
        through the BoundaryField port.  This module does not have a GUI.
	It has one input port, Input, and two output ports, Boundary,
        and Mapping.

        The FieldBoundary module builds an appropriate mesh from the
        incoming field.  FieldBoundary will build a QuadSurfMesh,
        TriSurfMesh, or CurveMesh as appropriate for the boundary type
        of the input field.

        The Boundary output port will contain the new boundary mesh with
        no data interpolated onto it.  If the data from the input
        field is desired on the output field, we recommended that
        using the Mapping output, running the results
        through <modref package="SCIRun" name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/> in order to draw values from the input
        field.
       </p>

      <developer>
	<p>Any interior face should be shared by two cells.  The boundary surface is calculated as the module checks each face that is shared by two or more cells. The faces that exist in one cell only are boundary faces.  This module can be used as a debugging tool becuase errors or holes in the mesh will show up as boundary faces.</p>

<title>FieldBoundary Regression Test</title>

<p>Use the FieldBoundary module to extract just the outside shell of the
sphere module, then use <modref package="SCIRun"
name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/> to put the values from the original field
onto the boundary.</p>

<net id="FieldBoundary-quadtest">
<title>FieldBoundary-quadtest Regression Test</title>

<p>Convert the sphere data set into a HexVol, then test FieldBoundary on
that HexVol to make sure that a QuadSurf is created successfully.
Then chop a chunk of that closed QuadSurf boundary out and test
FieldBoundary on that to make sure that the edge of the cut is
properly clipped out.  See also FieldBoundary-tritest.net</p>

<p>Test out the FieldBoundary module on a TetVolMesh, then clip out a
chunk of that closed sphere and test FieldBoundary on the resulting
TriSurfMesh to make sure that it is detected properly.  See also
