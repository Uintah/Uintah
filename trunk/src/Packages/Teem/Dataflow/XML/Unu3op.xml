    <p>Ternary operation on three nrrds or constants. Can have one,
     two, or three nrrds, but not zero.</p>
    <p>Operator: Binary operator. Possibilities include:</p>
    <p>    +, x, : sum or product of three values</p>
    <p>min, max : minimum, maximum</p>
    <p>clamp : second value is clamped to range between the first
    and the third</p>
    <p>ifelse : if 1st value non-zero, then 2nd value, else 3rd
    value</p>
    <p>lerp : linear interpolation between the 2nd and 3rd values,
    as the 1st value varies between 0.0 and 1.0, respectively</p>
    <p>exists : if the first value exists, use the second value,
    otherwise use the third</p>
    <p>in_op : 1 iff second value is is greater than first and less than 
    the second second, 0 otherwise</p>
    <p>in_cl : 1 iff second value is greater than or equal to the first 
    and less than or equal to second, 0 otherwise</p>
    <p>Float Input 1: This value is the first float value and will only
    be used if the first nrrd port isn't connected.</p>
    <p>Float Input 2: This value is the second float value and will only
    be used if the second nrrd port isn't connected.</p>
    <p>Float Input 3: This value is the third float value and will only
    be used if the third nrrd port isn't connected.</p>
    <p>Type : type to convert all input nrrds to prior to doing the operation.  To leave it unchanged, check the 'Same as input type' checkbutton.</p>
