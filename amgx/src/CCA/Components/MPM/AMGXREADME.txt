TODO for AMGX

1. Arches implementation
2. Parallel AMGX  - MPI implementation with IMPM
3. Get a list of processors that share a row or column in the matrix.
4. Need to have a mapping from your row to their column.
5. Column and row indices are local -- need mapping to global.
6. Look at the AMGX MPI example - amgx_mpi_capi_agg.c
