DESCRIPTION
   Creates the difference between two  geometry Pieces from the xml input 
   file description.
   Requires tow inputs: specify two geometry Pieces. The order is important.
   There are methods for checking if a point is inside the difference of 
   Pieces and also for determining the bounding box for the collection.
   The input form looks like this:
       <difference>
         <box>
	   <min>[0.,0.,0.]</min>
	   <max>[1.,1.,1.]</max>
	 </box>
	 <sphere>
	   <origin>[.5,.5,.5]</origin>
	   <radius>1.5</radius>
	 </sphere>
       </difference>
