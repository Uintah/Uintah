KEYWORDS
   SphereMembraneGeometryPiece  BoundingBox inside
        
DESCRIPTION
   Creates a sphere from the xml input file description.
   Requires five inputs: origin, radius and thickness as well as
   num_lat and num_long.  These last two indicate how many lines of
   latitude and longitude there are that are made up by particles.
   There are methods for checking if a point is inside the sphere
   and also for determining the bounding box for the sphere.
   The input form looks like this:
       <sphere_membrane>
         <origin>[0.,0.,0.]</origin>
         <radius>2.0</radius>
         <thickness>0.1</thickness>
         <num_lat>20</num_lat>
         <num_long>40</num_long>
       </sphere_membrane>
