CLASS
   KumariDaas 
   
   A version of the KumariDass equation of state, as described in
   M. Kumari and N. Dass. "An equation of state applied to 50 solids."

DESCRIPTION
   The Kumari-Dass equation of state is used for solids and has been applied 
   to various types.  It has similar accuracy to the Vinet equation of state.
   The upside is that unlike many other solid equations of state (e.g. JWL,
   Murnaghan, Birch-Murnaghan) it does not change sign at a relative volume
   of 1.
 
   It is based on the assumption that the bulk modulus, (B), varies with pressure (P)
   as:

   B=B_0+B_0'/lambda*(1-e^(lambda*P))
 
   where (B_0') if the derivative that is pressure independent, and (lambda) is 
   a softening parameter on the linearity of the bulk modulus.
