CLASS
   HypreSolverSMG
   
   A Hypre SMG (geometric multigrid #1) solver.

GENERAL INFORMATION

KEYWORDS
   HypreDriver, HypreSolverBase, HypreSolverParams.

DESCRIPTION
   Class HyprePrecondSMG sets up and destroys the Hypre SMG
   solver to be used with Hypre solvers. SMG is a geometric multigrid
   solver well suited for Poisson or a diffusion operator with a
   smooth diffusion coefficient.  SMG is used as to solve or as a
   preconditioner is often used with CG or GMRES.

WARNING
      Works with Hypre Struct interface only.
