# The purpose of this script is to find .d (Makefile dependency files)
# that have bad (old) include files in them and to delete the .d and
# corresponding .o file.  This is useful/necessary when you see an error
# like:
#
#    No rule to make target `../src/Dataflow/Modules/Render/SCIBaWGL.h'...
#
# In this case, you would run (from your build directory):
#
#    ../src/build_scripts/repair.sh SCIBaWGL.h
