  <title>SCIRun Utilities</title>

  
    <para>
      This chapter describes some simple utilities available in
      SCIRun.
    </para>
  

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      Core/Util is a miscellaneous collection of code.  The code can be
      classified into 3 groups: debugging tools, timing routines, and
      SCIRun internal code.
    </para>
    <para>The debugging tools and timing routines are generally useful.  The
      SCIRun internal code is not.
    </para>
    <para>The SCIRun internal code consists of routines for accessing shared
      libraries and work arounds of bugs on Linux platforms.
    </para>

    <title>Programming with SCIRun Utilities</title>

      <para>Use the the debugging and timing tools when developing any kind of code.</para>
      <para>
	Use the debugging tools to specify data invariants, catch
	programming errors, and log messages during program execution.
      </para>
      <para>
	The timer tools can be used to analyze code bottlenecks and perform
	other timing tasks.
      </para>
  
    <section>
      <title>Assertion</title>

    <para>
      Assertions have 2 (related) uses.  They are used to catch programming
      errors and they may used to make promises between a routine
      and its caller, i.e. "If you the caller send me data that does not
      violate my assertion(s) then I, the routine, promise to do the
      right thing by you." 
    </para>
    <para>
      Assertions express a set of valid states a data object (or objects)
      may possess at some point in the code.  If a piece of data is not in
      a valid state, i.e. it violates the assertion, then the assertion
      will catch this violation, report the violation, and perhaps terminate
      the program.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      SCIRun supports a number of assertion styles which can be found in
      Assert.h and FancyAssert.h.  Here are a few examples:
    </para>
    <para>
      Ensure that the variable 'n' is greater than 0:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      ASSERT(n &lt; 0);
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      Ensure that 'a' is equal to 999:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      ASSERTEQ(a, 999);
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      Other examples:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      ASSERTNE(a, 0);
      ASSERTRANGE(a, 0.0, 1.0);
    </programlisting>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Timer</title>
    <para>
      A Timer keeps track of time.  Class Timer is an abstract base class -
      you can't create a Timer object.  But you can create objects of the
      derived types CPUTimer, WallClockTimer, and TimeThrottle.  These all
      provide the functions start(), stop(), clear(), time(), and add().  A
      TimeThrottle also provides the function wait_for_time().  Functions
      common to all timers are:
    </para>
    <para>
      start() starts or resumes a timer.
    </para>
    <para>
      stop() stops a timer.  It does not clear accumulated time.  The timer
      may be resumed with start().
    </para>
    <para>
      clear() sets the timer's accumulated time to 0.  clear() may be executed
      while a timer is running (although a warning will be written to std error).
    </para>
    <para>
      time() returns the timer's accumulated time.  It may be executed
      while the timer is running or stopped.
    </para>
    <para>
      add(double t) adds t seconds to the current elapsed time.
    </para>
    <para>
      Individual timer types are discussed next.
    </para>
   </section>

   <section>
     <title>CPUTimer</title>
    <para>
      CPUTimer records the elasped CPU time (seconds) used by the calling
      process (including system CPU time used on behalf of the calling
      process).
    </para>

    <para>
      Sample use of a CPUTimer:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      CPUTimer cpuTimer;
      cpuTimer.start();
      for (i =0; i&lt;3; ++i) {
        .
        .
        .
      }
      cpuTimer.stop();
      cout &lt;&lt; "Loop used " &lt;&lt; cpuTimer.time()
           &lt;&lt; " seconds of cpu" &lt;&lt; endl;
    </programlisting>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>WallClockTimer</title>
    <para>
      WallClockTimer records elasped real time (seconds).
    </para>

    <para>
      Sample use of a WallClockTimer:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      WallClockTimer wcTimer;
      wcTimer.start();
      for (i =0; i&lt;3; ++i) {
        .
        .
        .
      }
      wcTimer.stop();
      cout &lt;&lt; "Loop used " &lt;&lt; wcTimer.time()
           &lt;&lt; " seconds of real time" &lt;&lt; endl;
    </programlisting>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>TimeThrottle</title>
    <para>
      TimeThrottle is a WallClockTimer with the added function wait_for_time().
    </para>
    <para>
      wait_for_time(double endtime) will suspend the calling thread until
      the given endtime (seconds) has elapsed.  This function is only
      implemented on SGI systems.
    </para>

    <para>
      Sample use of a TimeThrottle:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      TimeThrottle timeThrottle;
      timeThrottle.start();
      double startTime = timeThrottle.time();
      // Start doing stuff.
      .
      .
      .
      // Make sure that not less than 1 second has elapsed since we started
      // doing stuff.
      timeThrottle.wait_for_time(startTime + 1);
    </programlisting>
