<p class="title">SCIRun Exceptions</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>C++ has a facility for handling errors called <i>exceptions</i>. For more information 
  about exceptions, see your favorite modern C++ textbook.</p>

<p>If you see keywords like <b>try</b>, <b>catch</b>, and <b>throw</b>--you are 
  seeing exceptions.</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> Exceptions are great, but are also dangerous and can be misused. 
  To continue running your program after catching an exception, you will need 
  to carefully ensure that resources are appropriately cleaned up. In current 
  versions of SCIRun, we primarily use SCIRun to indicate catastrophic or near-catastrophic 
  failure. In this mode, many of the more serious difficulties do not arise.</p>


<h1>Exception Classes</h1>

<p>All exceptions thrown in SCIRun should be derived from a common
base class, SCIRun::Exceptions::Exception.  While this is not required
by C++, it allows SCIRun to more intellingently report what happened
when an exception is thrown and not caught.  This is an abstract base
class, requiring subsequently derived exception classes to implement
two methods: <b>message</b> which returns a user-readable explanation
string, and <b>type</b> which returns the string name of the class.
To avoid strong dependencies on std::string, these are implemented
using char* instead of using std::string.</p>

<p>There are several derived classes that are useful for reporting
errors in your code:
<ul>
  <li><b>InternalError</b>: Report a generic error.  This should be
      used when something has gone very wrong.
</ul>

Other exception classes will be added in the future.<p></p>

<p>A few others are used by other SCIRun facilities (described in the next two 
  sections): 
<ul>
  <li><b>ArrayIndexOutOfBounds</b>: Used by Array1, Array2 and Array3 to report 
    that an array has been accessed outside of its valid range. The index, lower 
    bound and upper bound are reported. 
  <li><b>AssertionFailed</b>: Used by the ASSERT, ASSERTEQ and
      ASSERTRANGE macros to indicate a failed assertion.
</ul>

<p>To use one of these, you would do something like this in your code:
<pre>
    throw InternalError("this is why I failed");
</pre>
Alternatively, you can use SCI_THROW or ASSERT (described below) for
more functionality.<p></p>

<p>You can create your own exception class by deriving from
SCIRun::Exceptions::Exception and implementing the message and type
methods.  InternalError is simple exception class that would make a
good prototype if you wanted to do this.  Exceptions that are broadly
applicable should go in SCICore/Exceptions, but others should go
nearer where they are used.</p>

<h1>SCI_THROW</h1>

<p>C++ exceptions have a drawback: they unwind the call stack, which
destroys any information which might have been useful for debugging
the problem.  To address this issue, I created a macro called
<b>SCI_THROW</b> (found in SCICore/Exceptions/Exception.h).  You would
use it in a similar form to the exceptions above:
<pre>
    SCI_THROW(InternalError("this is why I failed"));
</pre>

This should only be used for exceptions that are not going to be
caught by higher-level code.  Fist, SCI_THROW will display the
exception type and the exception message strings.  On an SGI, it will
additionally display a stack backtrace.  Next, SCI_THROW examines an
environment variable called <b>SCI_EXCEPTIONMODE</b> which describes
what should be done.  Here are the various options:
<ul>
  <li><b>dbx</b> (the default, used if SCI_EXCEPTIONMODE is not set).
      This brings up a dbx debugger in a window and attaches it to the
      thread that threw the exception. 
  <li><b>cvd</b> Similar to dbx, but fires up cvd instead (prepare to
      wait).  This is not likely to work on anything but an SGI.
  <li><b>abort</b> Calls abort.  The abort signal will be caught in
      the thread library, resulting in the familiar message:<br>
resume(r)/dbx(d)/cvd(c)/kill thread(k)/exit(e)?

  <li><b>throw</b> Does NOT print the information above, but just
      throws the exception through the usual C++ exception mechanism.
  <li><b>ask</b> Displays the information, and then reads a response
      from stdin.  Press d, c, a or t for the dbx, cvd, abort and
      throw options (respectively).
</ul>

<p>Here is a typical output from triggering SCI_THROW, with
SCI_EXCEPTIONMODE set to "ask".
<pre>
An exception was thrown.
Backtrace:
0x3fff990fb8: processDataflowComponent
0x3fff992144: processLibrary
0x3fff992bf4: processPackage
0x3fff994b68: PSECore::Dataflow::PackageDB::loadPackage(const SCICore::Containers::clString&)
0x100159b0: main

Exception type: SCICore::Exceptions::InternalError
Exception message: asdf

throw(t)/dbx(d)/cvd(c)/abort(a)? 
</pre>

<p>Inline functions will probably not show up in the stack backtrace.</p>

<h1>ASSERT and Friends</h1>

There is a macro in SCIRun called ASSERT (in SCICore/Util/Assert.h>,
similar to the assert macro found in /usr/include/assert.h.  However,
there are several additional features:

<ul>
  <li>It uses <b>SCI_THROW</b> (described above) to facilitate a more
      flexible handling of errors.
  <li>There are several "levels" of assertions, <b>ASSERTL1</b>, <b>ASSERTL2</b>, 
    and <b>ASSERTL3</b>. Higher numbered assertions are more expensive to check 
    and will be turned off in production. Optimized versions are lower numbers 
    that are not expensive to check. There is a configuration variable that defines 
    an assertion level: 
    <ul>
        <li>Level 0 - all assertions are turned off.
	<li>Level 1 - Only the macro <b>ASSERTL1</b> will be checked,
            all others are turned off.
	<li>Level 2 - Only the macros <b>ASSERTL1</b> and
            <b>ASSERTL2</b> will be checked, all others are turned
            off. 
	<li>Level 3 - All of the macros <b>ASSERTL1</b>,
            <b>ASSERTL2</b> and <b>ASSERTL3</b> will be
            checked. (lowest performance, most checking)
       </ul>
       To change the assertion level, use the configure flag
       <b>--enable-assertion-level=N</b>, where N is the desired
          assertion level (0-3).
       <p>The macro <b>ASSERT</b> is provided as a more convenient
          equivalent to <b>ASSERTL2</b>
  <li>There is an <b>ASSERTEQ</b> to assert that two quantities are
      equal.  ASSERTEQ(a, b) is functionaly equivalent to
      ASSERT(a==b), but ASSERTEQ will report the values of <b>a</b>
      and <b>b</b> in the failure message.  This is useful for
      debugging.  It can be used on any type which can be printed with
      an ostream.
  <li>There is an <b>ASSERTNE</b> which is equivalent to ASSERT(a !=
      b), similar to the above.
  <li>There is an <b>ASSERTRANGE</b> macro for checking that a
      quanitity is within a valid range.  ASSERTRANGE(q, l, h) is
      functionally equivalent to ASSERT(c >= l && c < h).  Similar to
      ASSERTEQ, it will print out the values of q, l and h in the
      failure message for debugging purposes.  This macro will work on
      any type which defines operator <, operator >= and an ostream <<
      operator. 
  <li>There is a <b>CHECKARRAYBOUNDS</b> macro which performs the same
      check as ASSERTRANGE, but throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
      exception instead.
  <li>There is an <b>ASSERTFAIL</b> statement to always fail. It would be
      better to "throw InternalError" descibed above.  However, this
      was provided for backwards compatibility with some old SCIRun
      code.
</ul>

<p>Most of the <b>ASSERT*</b> statements are found in
SCICore/Util/Assert.h, except for <b>ASSERTEQ</b>, <b>ASSERTNE</b>,
<b>ASSERTRANGE</b> are found in SCICore/Util/FancyAssert.h. To avoid
include file pollution, please do *not* include FancyAssert.h in any
.h file.</p>

<p>Here are several typical ASSERT statements:</p>
<pre>
 ASSERT(d_refCount &gt;= 0);
 ASSERTEQ(d_refCount, 0);
 ASSERT(mindex&lt;NumMaterials);
</pre>
<p>Look around the source tree for other examples.</p>
