<title>Thirdparty Software Installation and Build Information</title>

<section>
<para>
This chapter may help expedite installation of the
required third party software. However, this information is not
intended to replace the installation instructions that come with
the software, but to supplement them. Please read the install
instructions for each software distribution before attempting to
use this information. 
</para> 
</section>

<section>
<title>Prerequisites</title>
<para>
Use of this document requires experience with the SGI Irix 
operating system and/or the Linux operating system. Knowledge of
file systems, programming in C/C++, building software from
tarball distributions and shell scripting will be useful, if not
required. The installation or upgrade of core system components
(such as the OS and compilers) may be required. As such, a
system administrator's assistance may be warranted. 
</para> 

<para>
This information does not apply to the installation and upgrade of
the OS and build tools, as those topics are quite involved.
</para>

<section>
<title>Automatic Installation of All Thirdparty Software</title>

<para>
Because of many bugs and &quot;gotchas&quot; in the thirdparty
installation process, the easiest and most dependable means of
installation is the SCI Institute's thirdparty install
script.
</para> 

<para>
However, users may conduct a manual installation by following
the instructions on this page found in <xref linkend="miorts"/>
</para> 

<para>
The automatic install script comes with all the necessary
thirdparty software, and does not require additional
downloads. 
</para> 

<para>
To use the automatic install script do the following: 
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Download the install script tar ball from <ulink url="http://software.sci.utah.edu/software/download.xml?dir=0">here</ulink>.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Put the tar ball into a directory of your choosing.
</para>

<para>
Unzip and untar the tar ball:
</para>

<literallayout>
gunzip Thirdparty_install.<replaceable>x.x.x</replaceable>.tar.gz
tar xvf Thirdparty_install.<replaceable>x.x.x</replaceable>.tar
cd Thirdparty_install.<replaceable>x.x.x</replaceable>
</literallayout>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
	The install script is designed to help organize multiple installations for different architectures or compilers. 
	
Run the install script by typing:
</para>

<literallayout>
python install <replaceable>base-path</replaceable> <replaceable>architecture</replaceable> <replaceable>compiler bit-size</replaceable>
</literallayout>

<para>
Like this for: 32 bit binaries,  on Linux,  with a gcc 3.0.4 compiler, installed to /usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty :
</para>

<literallayout>
python install /usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty Linux gcc-3.0.4 32
</literallayout>

<para>
Your installation would then be under /usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty/Linux/gcc-3.0.4-32bit
</para>

<para>
You can also specify a faster parallel build by giving an
integer which provides the "number of jobs" argument for GNU make
For example,to build 32 bit binaries and libraries using 12 jobs,
type the following: 
</para> 

<literallayout>
python install 32 12
</literallayout>

<para>
When the install script finishes, it will display a message
regarding the <option>--with-thirdparty</option> SCIRun configure option.
Cut and paste that option when running the configure command 
for SCIRun. 
</para>

<para>
The install script requires Python version 1.5.2 or greater.
</para>

<para>
You may reinstall part or all of the required thirdparty software by 
repeating the above command.  This time since the target directory exists, 
you will be asked to replace all or part of the installation. Just answer 
y or n to the script until you have selected the exact reinstallation 
you wish.
</para>

<title>Manual Installation of Required Thirdparty Software</title>

<section>
<title>Recommended Build Tools</title>

<para>
You should use the same build tools to build the third party
software as is required for building SCIRun itself.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Recommended Installation Location</title>

<para>
SCIRun uses the latest versions of all the software that it
requires, and can be configured to use those versions regardless
of where that software is installed, whether it is all
installed in the same location or not.  However, if the
target install machine requires older versions of the same
software (for other programs) then it is recommended that all
the required third party software be installed into a
centralized and out-of-the-way directory rather than in a
directory already occupied by older versions of the third
party software. 
</para>

<para>
That said, if the target install machine only needs the
latest versions of software, or if it doesn't matter one way
or the other, then it is perfectly safe to install the
required thirdparty software into any directory including
directories where older versions are already installed.
</para>

<para>
An example of a centralized and out-of-the-way location would be:
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty such that after installation
the contents of that directory would look like this (assuming that
the tarballs were unzipped and untarred in the /src directory inside
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty):
</para>

<literallayout>
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty/bin
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty/include
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty/lib
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty/man 
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty/src
</literallayout>
</section>

<section>
<title>Recommended Configure Options</title>


<note>
<replaceable>INST_DIR</replaceable> 
represents
the chosen installation directory for the indicated software
distribution.  <replaceable>INST_DIR</replaceable>
would be "/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty" for the example given
above.  Note that the <replaceable>INST_DIR</replaceable>
does not have to be the same for each distribution, but can be if it
is desired as is demonstrated in the example.
