<H2><CENTER>Cocoon Web Page Creation System</CENTER></H2>

This page describes the use of Cocoon in SCIRun source code
documentation.  Cocoon generates web pages that contain browsable
source code.  Official Cocoon documentation is NOT
<A HREF="docs/cocoon.htm">here</A> YET.

<H3>Cocoon Vs XML</H3>

Documentation of source code in SCIRun is divided into several
different files.  Each file contains different types of information
(there may be some small overlap).

Note:  The following information is to be put in the associated
&lt;spec&gt.xml file:  Author, Creation Date, Project.

<P>

<TABLE BORDER=1>
  <TR>
    <TH> File Name </TH>
    <TH> Information Type </TH>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD> Module.h </TD>
    <TD> Cocoon documentation on class functions and variables. </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD> Module.xml </TD>
    <TD>
       Any information that a user might want during a run of the
       program.  This includes module author, a list of interfaces, a
       long description of the module and its algorithms, known bugs,
       etc.
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD> Other Files (.jpg, .ps, etc) </TD>
    <TD> Other information, perhaps in much greater depth, about the
    file.  Eg: Copies of papers that describe the algorithm in detail,
    images of the user interface, images of the output, etc. </TD>

<H3>Cocoon Class Comment Syntax</H3>

<P>

The following is the general syntax we employ for commenting
Class files using Cocoon:

<P>

<PRE>
/**************************************
CLASS
   MyClass
   Provide a sort description of MyClass here.  Also include a <B><U>link</U></B>
      to the .html file that is generated from the MyClass.xml file (which
      includes the long description, among other things.)

GENERAL INFORMATION
   MyClass.h
   (c) 2000
   Other general info you want to include that is not found in other files.

KEYWORDS [Note: appears in .xml file also]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;any keywords for cross referencing&gt;

# DESCRIPTION    <- Deprecated.  Now appears in the .xml file.
# &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;complete description&gt;

# WARNING        <- Deprecated. Now appears in the .xml file.
# &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;anything users should be aware of&gt;

[OTHER SECTIONS]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Any other information you feel is important to reference.&gt;
****************************************/</PRE>

<P>CLASS is a Cocoon keyword that tells Cocoon to begin looking
at the this Class specification. KEYWORDS tells Cocoon to use
the provided list as a hypertext index to find this class. (<B>Though
more than one keyword is allowed, each keyword must be a single
word. If you want to use a keyword that consists of more than
one word, use an underscore between each of the words.</B>) Other
sections (consisting of all CAPITAL letters) are user defined.</P>

<P>Within the class declaration special comment strings are needed
to notify Cocoon of the existence of functions. This comment string
is <TT>//////////</TT> and must appear on the line above each
member function. It also should appear one line above any variable,
typedefs, or enumerated types that might be in the <B>.H</B> file.
A comment in the form <TT>// GROUP: &lt;group name&gt;</TT> can
be used to group related functions together.</P>

<H3>C-SAFE Cocoon Example<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION--></H3>

<P>Here is an example, <A HREF="Halton.html">the Halton Class</A>,
that was created for the C-SAFE project. The .h file that was
used to create the browsable page is <A HREF="Halton.h">Halton.h</A>.
Take a look at it as a beginning example of how to 'instrument'
a .h file. A version of Halton.h with <B>Coding Standards</B>
and <B>Cocoon Keywords</B> explicitly labeled is <A HREF="commented_Halton.h">here</A>.
(If the &quot;//FYI:&quot; comments where stripped from this file,
it would match the Halton.h above.)</P>

<H3>How To Use Cocoon</H3>

At regular intervals, a automated script will run Cocoon on the entire
source tree and copy the generated files to the SCIRun Documentation web
site.  However, individual developers can (and should) keep their copy
of the documentation up to date by periodically running the following
command in their source repository:
<P>
<B>&gt; gmake cocoon</B> <FONT COLOR=red># THIS DOES NOT WORK YET!</FONT>
<P>
This will run Cocoon on their local copy of the source tree and
generate up to date .html files.
