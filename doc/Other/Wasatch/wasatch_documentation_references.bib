  abstract = {One major drawback of the eddy viscosity subgrid‐scale stress models
	used in large‐eddy simulations is their inability to represent
	correctly with a single universal constant different turbulent fields
	in rotating or sheared flows, near solid walls, or in transitional
	regimes. In the present work a new eddy viscosity model is presented
	which alleviates many of these drawbacks. The model coefficient is
	computed dynamically as the calculation progresses rather than input
	a priori. The model is based on an algebraic identity between the
	subgrid‐scale stresses at two different filtered levels and the
	resolved turbulent stresses. The subgrid‐scale stresses obtained
	using the proposed model vanish in laminar flow and at a solid boundary,
	and have the correct asymptotic behavior in the near‐wall region
	of a turbulent boundary layer. The results of large‐eddy simulations
	of transitional and turbulent channel flow that use the proposed
	model are in good agreement with the direct simulation data.},

	complex geometries. This model which is based on the square of the
	velocity gradient tensor accounts for the effects of both the strain
	and the rotation rate of the smallest resolved turbulent fluctuations.
	Moreover it recovers the proper y 3 near-wall scaling for the eddy

  abstract = {Subgrid-models for Large Eddy Simulation {(LES)} of compressible turbulent
	flow are tested for the three-dimensional mixing layer. For the turbulent
	stress tensor the recently developed dynamic mixed model yields reasonable
	results. A priori estimates of the subgrid-terms in the filtered
	energy equation show that the usually neglected pressure-dilatation
	and turbulent dissipation rate are as large as the commonly retained
	pressure-velocity subgrid-term. Models for all these terms are proposed:
	a similarity model for the pressure-dilatation, similarity and k
	-dependent models for the turbulent dissipation rate and a dynamic
	mixed model for the pressure-velocity subgrid-term. Actual {LES}
	demonstrates that for a low Mach number all subgrid-terms in the
	energy equation can be neglected, while for a moderate Mach number
	the effect of the modelled turbulent dissipation rate is larger than
	the combined effect of the other modelled subgrid-terms in the filtered
	energy equation.},
