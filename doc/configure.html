  <tr>
    <td>--enable-scirun<br>
        --enable-uintah<br>
        --enable-davew<br>
        --enable-mcq<br>
    <td>Compile the package indicated.  At least one
        must be specified.  Uintah is enabled by default;
        you can turn it off with --disable-uintah
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-exename=NAME
    <td>call the executable NAME instead of the default 'pse'
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-debug
    <td>Turn on debugging.  This adds the -g flag to compiles.  To
        use something else besides -g, use --enable-debug="-myflags"
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-optimize
    <td>Turn on optimization.  This adds the -O2 flag to
        compiles.  To use something else besides -O2,
        use --enable-optimize="-myflags"
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-enterleave
    <td>enable the annoying "Entering directory..." and
        "Leaving directory..." messages from make, which help
        emacs find the errors from the compile output.
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-64bit
    <td>compile in 64 bit mode instead of in 32 bit mode.   Available
        on the following platforms: Irix
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-threads=IMPL
    <td>Set the thread implementation to IMPL.  pthreads is the
        default, except on irix.  You can use --enable-threads=pthreads
        to get pthreads support on Irix.
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-assertion-level=N
    <td>set the assertion level to N (default=3).  Assertion level 0 is no
        assertions (fastest), level 1 is few assertions, level 2 is most
        assertions, and level 3 is all assertions, including array
        bounds checking (slowest).
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-parllel
    <td>Compile the new distributed memory parallel PSE.  This is
        very experimental and may break many things.  It is also a
        much different world.
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-globus=DIR
    <td>Use the globus installation in DIR.  Only applicatble
        with the --enable-parallel option.
  </tr>

A typical configuration would be:<p>

<code><ul>
./configure --enable-scirun --enable-enterleave
</ul></code><p>
