    <summary>Clip a scalar field to a specified isovalue.</summary>
    <description>

    <p>The IsoClip module is used to clip a TetVol or TriSurf field
    along a particular isovalue.  The isovalue is specified by the
    entry in the GUI.  The new field can contain either the values
    less than or greater than the isovalue, as selected by the user. </p>

    <p> In order to compute where the cuts
    are to be made, the input field must contain scalar values at the
    nodes.  If the input field contains element centered data then either
    just use <modref package="SCIRun" name="ClipByFunction"/> to determine which elements to keep or
    interpolate the elements onto a node-centered field. </p>

    <p> Only TetVol and TriSurf fields are supported by this general
    clipping.  Other fields should be converted into these types if
    they are to be clipped.  See <modref package="SCIRun" name="HexToTet"/>, <modref package="SCIRun" name="QuadToTri"/>, and <modref package="SCIRun" name="Unstructure"/>
    for an idea of how to do this conversion. </p>

<title>IsoClip-boundarytest Regression Test</title>

<p>Test the IsoClip module to make sure that the outer clip boundary is
consistent.  We do this by creating a regular lattice with a distance
function at the nodes, then converting that lattice into a tetrahedral
mesh and doing the IsoClip to get a sphere.  The sphere is then run
through <modref package="SCIRun" name="FieldBoundary"/> and half of it is clipped away with
<modref package="SCIRun" name="ClipByFunction"/> so that we can see the interior.  If everything is
working properly we will then see a relatively smooth hemispherical
bowl.  If the adjacent tetrahedra are miscut then the interior has a
rough geode appearance because all of the miscut tetrahera are added
to the boundary.</p>

<p>Test the IsoClip module to make sure that the data from the input
field is preserved in the output field.</p>

<net id="IsoClip-probe">
<title>IsoClip-probe Regression Test</title>

<p>Example network demonstrating the use of a <modref package="SCIRun" name="Probe"/> widget to determine
where an IsoClip should take place.  A Tetrahedral mesh is created by
mapping the distance function onto a unit lattice.  Then the probe is
used to extract an isovalue from that Tetrahedral mesh which is then
passed through <modref package="SCIRun" name="ManageFieldData"/> to convert it into a matrix and then
used by IsoCilp to determine which value to clip against.</p>

<net id="IsoClip-tet">
<title>IsoClip-tet Regression Test</title>

<p>Test networks for the IsoClip module.  TetVolMesh and TriSurfMesh
field types are both supported by the IsoClip module so we make sure
that they are both working.</p>
