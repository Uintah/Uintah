      <p>Version Date: Fri Nov 17 12:03:26 MST 2000</p><p>Version: 1.0</p>

      <p>We will store all of the Manip info in GuiStrings: 
      mlibs_gui, mlibpath_gui, mincludes_gui, and mnames_gui.  
      Each will actually contain a list of strings (one for each manip).
      And we will have one GuiString, mcurr_name_gui, that stores the name of
      the currently selected manip.</p>

      <p>The values that appear on the Gui will initially be the
      defaults that are in ManipMatrix.tcl or that are set by a .net file
      The Gui has a button for loading the .xml file, which when pressed will
      send a tcl_command to parse the .xml file and overwrite these variables;
      the Gui then reconfigures itself with these values.  Because the Gui has
      to wait for the variables to be read/set, the work has to be done through
      tcl_command, rather than through execute.  So we have to have locks
      around those sets to ensure thread safety.</p>

      <p>If the user tries to change a value without sourcing the .xml file, it
      will automatically be sourced and the new values will be compared to
      the old.  If the name of the manip being edited has changed, no changes
      will be made.  On the Gui side, all variables must be reloaded after
      every request to change a value.</p>

      <p>If the user requests a "compile", then the current .o and .so
      files will be removed and rebuilt.</p>

      <p>There should not be any static variables in this module -- state
      should now be independent for each instantiation.</p>

      <p>All of the info about all of the manips is stored in the
      GuiString -- we don't try to replicate it in a real struct since
      we'd have to worry about keeping them in sync.  Rather, we have
      a helper function to index into tcl lists (called "lindex" -- just
      like in tcl).</p>
