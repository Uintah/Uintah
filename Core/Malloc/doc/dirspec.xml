  <!-- describe how this directory fits into SCIRun - why does it 
       exist, how does SCIRun benefit from it, etc. -->
    <p>
      Core/Malloc implements the SCIRun memory allocation and tracking
      system.  This system is an abstracted layer built upon the
      normal memory management tools provided in C/C++.  

      At one point or another, most programs run into problems with
      dynamically allocated memory such as stray pointers and memory
      leakage.  Because SCIRun is a large and complex collection of
      core routines as well as a framework for the creation and use of
      user modules (used to extend its base functionality,) it is
      important to be able to track the allocation and usage of
      memory.

      Core/Malloc provides a transparent, non-invasive method of
      tracking memory usage.  By overloading the basic C memory
      management routines (malloc, free, calloc, realloc, memalign,
      and valloc) as well as the C++ routines (new and delete,) SCIRun
      can record and monitor the allocation of memory throughout the
      system.  This makes it much easier to perform two very important
      functions: 1) Know where memory was allocated, and thus, if
      appropriate, where it was not freed, and 2) easily track the
      amount of memory being used by the entire system.  Core/Malloc
      provides one other important benefit:  Memory allocation can be,
      and often is, faster because of the smarter algorithms it uses.

    <why>
    <!-- Discuss why a developer would need or want to use the
         functions and/or classes in this directory. -->
      <p>
        For the reasons mentioned above, it is important for
        developers to use the Core/Malloc routines in order for
        themselves or others to localize and fix and memory problems
        encountered when using SCIRun.

    <when>
    <!-- Discuss when or where to use the functions and classes in
         this directory: From within modules?, when a certain event
	 occurs? -->
      <p>
        Anytime a developer needs to allocate memory, he or she should
        use the Core/Malloc routines, thereby receiving for free, the
        ability to track memory usage.  The important thing to note is
        that the developer need only do one thing to make this happen:
        Use the SCIRun macro "scinew" anywhere he or she would
        normally use "new".  Because "scinew" is a macro, it can be
        easily configured to allow the default "new" to be used when
        desired.

  <!-- Give the definition for a term, or concept, that is embodied
       by this directory.  Please provide feature length rather than
       short story definitions. -->
    <term>
      Environment Variables
    </term>
    <p>
      The following environment variables can be set in order to help
      monitor and control the allocation of memory.  The environment
      variables are only used if DISABLE_SCI_MALLOC is NOT defined
      during compilation.  If DISABLE_SCI_MALLOC is defined, then
      SCIRun will use the built in new, free, alloc, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALLOC_STRICT: Places markers in unused memory and uses them to
      verify memory integrity.  Unless you wish to check memory
      integrity explicitly using the "audit()" function, MALLOC_LAZY
      should NOT be set.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALLOC_LAZY: By default, memory is audited for problems on each
      allocation and deallocation.  If MALLOC_LAZY is set, then
      auditing is turned off.  This can speed up code that allocates
      and deallocates memory frequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      MALLOC_TRACE [filename]: If MALLOC_TRACE is set, then every
      memory allocation, reallocation, and deallocation will be
      logged.  If "filename" is not provided, this information will be
      printed to "stderr".
    </p>
    <p>
      MALLOC_STATS [filename]: If MALLOC_STATS is set, when SCIRun
      exits, it will output a list of statistics regarding memory
      usage during the run.  This includes the number of alloc/free
      calls, the amount of fragmentation, the amount of memory that is
      free and that is in use, etc.  If "filename" is not provided,
      then "stderr" is used.
    </p>

    <term>
       Overloaded Functions
    </term>
    <p>
      The following memory management functions are overloaded to
      allow Core/Malloc to provide memory management functionality:
      <pre>
        C Functions:

        void* malloc(size_t size);
	void free(void* ptr);
	void* calloc(size_t n, size_t s);
	void* realloc(void* p, size_t s);
	void* memalign(size_t alignment, size_t size);
	void* valloc(size_t size);
	
	C++ Functions:

	void* operator new(size_t, SCIRun::Allocator*, char*);
	void* operator new[](size_t, SCIRun::Allocator*, char*);
	#define scinew new(SCIRun::default_allocator, __FILE__)
      </pre>
    </p>
  </definition>

  <example>
  <!-- give an example of how to use the classes and/or functions
       here.  Again, more is better, however give only exactly 
       that which is being explained, no superfluous text (i.e.
       please don't cut and paste from existing code.) -->
    
    <p>
      To take advantage of the SCIRun memory management utilities
      provided by Core/Malloc, you should do the following:

      1) Make sure that DISABLE_SCI_MALLOC is not set.      

      2) Allocate memory using the following syntax (This can 
      be transparently done by changing every "new" to "scinew"):

      int * int_array = scinew int[ 128 ];

      Object * obj = scinew Object();

      3) Delete objects as normal:

      delete int_array[];
      delete obj;

    </p>
  </example>
