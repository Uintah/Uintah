<h1>TBONUG</h1>

<b>Description:</b><p>

<a href="template.html">Template class</a> (Please read!)<p>

<i>OK, sit down.  Using this module can be a very complicated,
time-consuming process.  The preprocessing you need to do
is very complex.  I've tried to lay it out as best I can
below.  Don't say you weren't warned.</i><p>

Implementation of the Temporal Branch-on-Need Octree (T-BON) for 
unstructured scalar fields (see the thesis for more details).
My definition of "unstructured" is purely tetrahedral elements, 
where the grid does NOT change over time.<p>

First I'll walk through the preprocessing.<p>

<h3>First step</h3>

First you need to get your data into the HTvol format that
rtrt uses.  That format looks like:<br>

<pre>
HTVolumeBrick file    (in ASCII text)
#points #tets         (in ASCII text)
p0x p0y p0z data0     (in binary - vertex locations + data value at vertex)
p1x p1y p1z data1 
...
t0_0 t0_1 t0_2 t0_3   (in binary - vertex connectivity info)
t1_0 t1_1 t1_2 t1_3
...
</pre>

Then you can use rtrt to get an idea for how many rectilinear cells
you should divide the volume into.  Use one of the commands from
htvol_command_lines and substitute the name of your htvol file.
For example:<p>

rtrt -np 16 -res 300x300 -scene htvolumebrick -camera -1055.23 254.832 190.605 -lookat 32.8377 -0.803524 305.187 -up 0.0889134 0.697259 0.711284 -fov 25.8258 -iso 27.6 -light -1055.23 254.832 190.605 torso_ug.htvol
<p>

You don't have to let this run, it'll spit out the nx, ny and nz you
need pretty early.  You then want to feed this into the HTlists
program (found in the rtrt directory).  This isn't very well documented
(I think it was written by Mike Parker map@cs.utah.edu).  The usage is:<p>

<pre>
HTlists &lt name.htvol &gt &lt nx &gt &lt ny &gt &lt nz &gt
</pre>
<p>

This will create a file called <i>name.lists</i> that you'll need in
the next step.  You only have to do this once for a data set, since
I assume the mesh doesn't change over time.
<p>


<h3>Separation</h3>

This step solves (or at least relieves) the replication problem.
You start with an htvol file for each time step, but since the 
grid doesn't change over time, much of that file (all the connectivity
information) is replicated, once per time step.<p>

The "separate" directory contains some code that you should
compile to an executable ("separate").  That executable
takes all your timestep htvol files and the lists file and munges
them into something that the TBONUG module can deal with more easily.
The usage is:<p>

<pre>
separate &lt htvol_files* &gt &lt lists_file (name.lists above) &gt 
   &lt geometry_file &gt &lt data_files** &gt &lt nx &gt &lt ny &gt &lt nz &gt
</pre>
<p>

* This file lists the htvol files you have, e.g.
<pre>
./file0.htvol
./file1.htvol
...
./file10.htvol
</pre>
<p>

** This file lists the destination filenames for each data file, e.g.
<pre>
./data0
./data1
...
./data10
</pre>

The <i>geometry file</i> will be created, containing the vertex and
connectivity information.  All the files in <i>data_files</i> will
be created, containing the data values at each vertex.<p>

<b>Warning!</b> This process will probably take a <b>long</b>
time!  In fact, I've seen data sets where it doesn't work at all.
I don't understand this (I think it chokes if the data set gets too
big).

<h3>Module Preprocessing</h3>

Almost done!  The last step resembles the preprocessing done in
the <a href="tboncl.html">TBONCL</a> module.  The metafile looks like:<p>

PREPROCESS<br>
<i>filename for data file list*<br>
geometry file name</i><br>
nx ny nz<br>
<i>filename for common tree data<br>
per-tree file base<br>
new geometry file (condensed)**</i><br>
<p>

* As before, format this as follows: <p>
data file 0 (from separate step)<br>
data file 1<br>
...<br>
<p>

** The "separate" step evenly subdivides space and places copies of
tetrahedra in each subvolume they inhabit.  This means some subvolumes
may be empty.  You can collpase those subvolumes by specifying a 
threshold in the TBONUG GUI during preprocessing.  See the thesis for
more details.  If you do set a positive threshold, the geometry of
the mesh doesn't change, but it needs to be reordered to accomodate
the new tree structure.  If the threshold is zero, then the old
geometry file just gets copied into this file.<p>


<h2>Module Execution</h2>

Now things can work like they did in the other T-BON modules.
Here's the TBONUG execution metafile format:<p>

EXECUTE<br>
<i>filename for common tree data<br>
geometry file (condensed)<br>
filename for per-tree data file list*</i><br>
miniso maxiso slider_resolution<br>
num_timesteps<br>
<p>

* As before, format this as:<p>

<pre>
per-tree file 0      data file 0
per-tree file 1      data file 1
...
</pre>

So that's it.  If you have problems, let me know, but I may not 
know how to solve anything.
