    <summary>
      Build a mapping matrix -- a matrix that says how to project
      the data from one field onto the data of a second field.
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        This module builds a mapping matrix which contains information
        about how to interpolate the data from the source field onto
        the geometry of the destination field.  The resulting
        mapping matrix can then be used by the <modref package="SCIRun" name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/>
        module to map the values from a field similar to the
        source field onto the destination field.
      </p>
      <p>
        The source field for BuildMappingMatrix and <modref package="SCIRun" name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/>
        must contain the same geometry and data locations.  However
        they do not have to contain the same data values or value
        types.  For instance, a TetVolField of doubles with data at the
        nodes can be passed into the Source port of BuildMappingMatrix,
        and a TetVolField of Vectors with data also at the nodes and with
        the same mesh can be passed into the source port of
        <modref package="SCIRun" name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <modref package="SCIRun" name="DirectMapping"/> should be used instead of BuildMappingMatrix
        and <modref package="SCIRun" name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/> if the mapping is not to be reused,
        as it does the same interpolation without building the
        intermediate mapping matrix.  This should be used if the
        source field changes much more often than the destination field.

<title>BuildMappingMatrix Regression Test</title>

<p>Build an interpolant from an input field onto a plane using
BuildMappingMatrix, and then apply the data from the input field back to
the interpolant field.</p>

<p>Note that the same thing could be done by replacing both
BuildMappingMatrix and <modref package="SCIRun" name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/> with a <modref package="SCIRun" name="DirectMapping"/> module.
ApplyMappingMatrix was meant primarily to be used in conjunction with
loops and time dependent data, such that the interpolant field could
be computed once and then applied multiple times.</p>

<p>See also <modref package="SCIRun" name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/>, <modref package="SCIRun" name="DirectMappingMatrix"/>, <modref package="SCIRun" name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/>.</p>
