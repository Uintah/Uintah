Array1 is a parameterized type (template class) that implements a
flexible one dimensional array.

An array is constructed with the following:
Array1(int size=0, int default_grow_size=10, int asize=-1);
This looks fairly complex, but encapulates the simple way of using
the arrays also.  In it's simplest form, with no arguments, Array1
allocates an array which has 0 elements, and which allocates 10
elements at a time when growing the array.  The next most common form,
with a single integer argument, allocates an array of the specified
size.  Using the second  you can specify how many new elements are
allocated each time the array is reallocated.  Using a larger number
for this will cause fewer reallocations when slowly building a large
array, but is more wasteful when using small arrays.  The third
argument specifies how many elements to allocate initially.  This can
be used to jump start the growth of a large array.

The array is accessed through the following methods:

// Accesses the nth element of the array
T& operator[](int n)

// Returns the size of the array
int size() 

// Make the array larger by count elements
void grow(int count, int grow_size=10);

// Add one element to the array.  equivalent to:
//  grow(1)
//  array[array.size()-1]=data;
void add(const T& data);

// Remove one element from the array.  This is very inefficient
// if you remove anything besides the last element.
void remove(int);

// Remove all elements in the array.  The array is not freed,
// and the number of allocated elements remains the same.
void remove_all();
