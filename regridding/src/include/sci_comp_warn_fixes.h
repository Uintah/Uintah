   // This macro is used in procedures that can not reach the end of the
   // function, and thus the SGI compiler warns that you have a
   // 'unreachable' statement.  However, if you don't have it under gnu,
   // then you get a 'this function must return a value' warning.
#  define RETURN_FALSE
#  define RETURN_NULL
#  define RETURN_0
#  define RETURN

   // This removes compiler warnings about unreachable statements.
   // Only use BREAK after lines that will kill the program.  Otherwise
   // use the normal 'break'.
#  define BREAK 

#else

#  define RETURN_FALSE return false
#  define RETURN_NULL return NULL
#  define RETURN_0 return 0
