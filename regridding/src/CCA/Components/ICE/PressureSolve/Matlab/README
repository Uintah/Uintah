Update 12-JUL-2005
* Works for general dimension (tested in 2D with a=1 so far).
* Supports adaptive mesh refinement for an L-shaped problem.
* Accuracy so far is in accordance with theory (second order in L2, and
even better than the expected first order in H1, but H1 is not yet the proper
energy norm).
* Tested normally for a problem with a known continuous solution.
