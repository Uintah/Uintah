TODO List - Hypre Stand-Alone Driver
====================================
1. Replace the util.cc functions add, subtract, etc. for vectors by operator
   +/-/... overloading for vectors.
2. See 1: or at least make them return a vector, not put it in result. We can
   suffer the copying of vector objects in assignment.
3. Replace Print0Proc, Print by cout, parse if there's a \n in the printed
   string and put a "P %2d" header before it.
4. Use cout and cerr instead of printf and fprintf.
5. Comments from /* */ to // .
6. Box iterator instead of IndexPlusPlus().
7. Make Point = Vector<int>.
8. Delete patches in ~Level and ~Hierarchy.
9. Copy constructor and equality operator for Patch.
10. Instead of a double list (owner/patch), make one big sorted list of patches
   for each proc.
