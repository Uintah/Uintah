To configure Uintah, use:
../src/configure  --enable-64bit --enable-package=Uintah --enable-debug 

For an optimized 64bit build, use:
./src/configure  --enable-64bit --enable-package=Uintah \
 '--enable-optimize=-Ofast -G0 -OPT:Olimit=20000 -IPA:plimit=20000' \
 --disable-sci-malloc --enable-assertion-level=0

SUS_GOOD AND SUS_SUSPECT                      07/17/02 (Todd)
 
If you want to keep a "good" sus around to compare against while you 
work on "suspect" code.  

- First build a "good" sus
- mkdir good_sus     ( you need a separate dir for mpi to work>
- mv sus good_sus/.
- mkdir SCIRun/src/good_libs
- cp -r SCIRun/src/lib/ SCIRun/src/good_libs/.
- In a terminal that will ONLY be used to run good_sus/sus
    unsetenv LD_LIBRARY64_PATH
    setenv  LD_LIBRARY64_PATH /hd3/harman/SCIRun/src/good_libs:/usr/installed/SCIRun_Thirdparty_64/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/lib64
 
and it should work.  I'd recommend that you put something like cout<< "SUSPECT CODE"<<endl;
somewhere in your code just to be sure.

Essentially LD_LIBRARY64_PATH sets the path where you want the executable to look.  
Don't run any other applications from this terminal since you've wiped out their
 library paths. Compile and run your suspect code in a different terminal.

If you want mpi to work you'll need to add 

if ( $cwd == "<path>/good_sus/" ) then
 echo "setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH now"
 setenv  LD_LIBRARY64_PATH /hd3/harman/SCIRun/src/good_libs:/usr/installed/SCIRun_Thirdparty_64/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/lib64
endif

to your .cshrc file.  MPI wipes out your environmental variables but it sources your
.cshrc file so you can put a little hack in there.

MOVING SUS TO n02

Here are the details on getting a locally compiled sus to 
run at LANL.  Basically, you scp down sus, puda, compare_uda, 
set the environmental variable LD_LIBRARY64_PATH and away you go.

____________Details______________
On n02:

mkdir remotely_built
cd remotely_built
scp    harman@fin.mech.utah.edu:/usr/people/harman/Csafe/SCIRun/src/Packages/Uintah/StandAlone/sus" .
scp -r harman@fin.mech.utah.edu:/usr/people/harman/Csafe/SCIRun/src/lib  .
scp -r harman@fin.mech.utah.edu:/usr/people/harman/Csafe/SCIRun/src/Packages/Uintah/StandAlone/inputs .
scp    harman@fin.mech.utah.edu:/usr/people/harman/Csafe/SCIRun/src/Packages/Uintah/StandAlone/compare_uda .
scp    harman@fin.mech.utah.edu:/usr/people/harman/Csafe/SCIRun/src/Packages/Uintah/StandAlone/puda .
setenv LD_LIBRARY64_PATH /users/tbh/Csafe/remotely_built/lib:/usr/projects/Uintah/SCIRun_Thirdparty_64/lib:$LD_LIBRARY64_PATH

At this point sus, puda and compare_uda should be working for a single processor.
If you want mpi to work you'll need to add 

if ( $cwd == "/users/tbh/Csafe/remotely_built" ) then
 echo "setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH now"
 setenv LD_LIBRARY64_PATH /users/tbh/Csafe/remotely_built/lib:/usr/projects/Uintah/SCIRun_Thirdparty_64/lib:$LD_LIBRARY64_PATH
endif

to your .cshrc file.  MPI wipes out your environmental variables but it sources your
.cshrc file so you can put a little hack in there.
