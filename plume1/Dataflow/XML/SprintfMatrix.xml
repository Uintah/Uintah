      This module does a sprintf with input matrices into a new string.
    </summary>
    <description>
      This module module takes in a formatted string (a string with %01d, %4.5f,
      %g etc) and takes the numbers of the input matrix and puts these formatted
      numbers into the string. The input matrix can be a scalar but can as well
      be a full dense matrix. The module takes each number out of the matrix and
      puts it in the formatted number string. For example in order to plot the 
      contents of a 1 by 3 vector one may choose a formatstring of '%f %f %f\n',
      which will put all three value in the matrix in the formatted string. If
      there are more numbers in the matrix then in the format string then the current
      format string will be reused. Hence to get the contents of a 4 by 4 matrix in
      a comma seperated list one can choose a format string of '%5.5f, '. This
      will apply this format string to each number in the matrix. In case multiple
      matrices are supplied, first all the values of the first matrix will be used,
      then all the numbers of the next matrix etc. When there are more positions
      in the matrix where one can fill out a number then the rest will be padded
      with the value 0.0.
      Note the formatstring may contain '%s', which will remain in the format string
      and is not touched by this module. To insert strings use SprintfString
      instead.
