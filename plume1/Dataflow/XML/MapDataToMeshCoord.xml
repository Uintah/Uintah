    <summary>Replace a mesh coordinate with the scalar fdata values.</summary>
    <description>
      <p> For unstructured data (HexVol, TetVol, QuadSurf, TriSurf,
          Curve, PointCloud) change the positions of the nodes by
	  replacing one of the coordinates with the Field data.
          (Note: this is obviously only supported for scalar data
          types.)  Per Allen's request, for surface meshes, also
          support "pushing" the nodes by (normal x data).  This
          module is useful for turning cutting planes into
          heightfields, and for "inflating/deflating" surfaces.
