      <p>
        ChooseColorMap takes in an arbitrary number of input colormaps, and
        passes one of them downstream, based on the port index typed
        in the UI.  Input port specification is 0 based (ie: first
        port is 0, 2nd port is 1, etc.)

        ChooseColorMap takes in an arbitrary number of input colormaps, and
        passes one of them downstream, based on the port index typed
        in the UI.  Input port specification is 0 based (ie: first
        port is 0, 2nd port is 1, etc.) If the Use first valid colormap option is checked, the module will disregard the port index and iterate over the input ports, passing the first valid data downstream.
