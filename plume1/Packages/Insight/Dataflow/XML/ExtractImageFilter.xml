<p>Decrease the image size by cropping the image to the selected region bounds.</p>

<p>ExtractImageFilter changes the image boundary of an image by removing pixels outside the target region. The target region must be specified.</p>

<p>ExtractImageFilter also collapses dimensions so that the input image may have more dimensions than the output image (i.e. 4-D input image to a 3-D output image). To specify what dimensions to collapse, the ExtractionRegion must be specified. For any dimension dim where ExtractionRegion.Size[dim] = 0, that dimension is collapsed. The index to collapse on is specified by ExtractionRegion.Index[dim]. For example, we have a image 4D = a 4x4x4x4 image, and we want to get a 3D image, 3D = a 4x4x4 image, specified as [x,y,z,2] from 4D (i.e. the 3rd "time" slice from 4D). The ExtractionRegion.Size = [4,4,4,0] and ExtractionRegion.Index = [0,0,0,2].</p>

<p>The number of dimension in ExtractionRegion.Size and Index must = InputImageDimension. The number of non-zero dimensions in ExtractionRegion.Size must = OutputImageDimension. </p>
