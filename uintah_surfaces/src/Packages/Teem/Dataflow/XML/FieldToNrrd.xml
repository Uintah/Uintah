         This module converts data from a given field, into NrrdData.
NrrdData is the SCIRun object that is mostly a wrapper around a Nrrd*.
There are many operations that can be applied to the data as a nrrd,
<slink path="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gk/teem/unnrrdu/index.html"></slink>
many of which are supported in this Teem package. </p>

	<p>Run the test network (see examplesr tag), and verify that
