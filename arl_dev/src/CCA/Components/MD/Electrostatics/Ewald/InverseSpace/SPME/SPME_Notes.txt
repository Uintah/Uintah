To store information for the SPME calculation, we have an SPME patch object.
The SPMEPatch object has the following data containers:

Type							Name				Use
----							----				---
IntVector						d_localExtents		The number of kGrid points 
													mapped to the current patch
													
IntVector						d_globalOffset		The index into the global 
													kGrid map that coincides
													with the current patch's local
												    0,0,0 location.
													(Real grid location = 
														globalOffset + 
														internal grid index)

IntVector						d_posGhostExtents	Number of ghost cells in 
													positive directions
													
IntVector						d_negGhostExtents	Number of ghost cells in 
													negative directions

SimpleGrid<double>*				d_theta				Patch's compositied B*C
													component in fourier space
											
SimpleGrid<Matrix3>				d_stressPrefactor	Patch's stress tensor 
													premultiplier grid
													
SimpleGrid<dblcomplex>			d_Q_patchLocal		Grid which holds complex 
													valued function which reduces
													to the total SPME 3D data set

const Patch*					d_patch				Pointer to the Uintah patch
													this SPME patch represents
													
vector< vector<SPMEMapPoint> >	d_chargeMapVector	An array of SPME Map Points
													which map each particle on
													the patch to it's delocalized
													grid representation of charge,
													dipole, and dipole derivative
													influence on the underlying
													SPME data grid.
