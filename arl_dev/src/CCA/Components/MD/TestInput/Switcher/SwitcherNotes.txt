 JBH -- Debugging attempt to run 2-component switching
 APH has added in direct calls for each component's initialize component
     however, on calling MD::initialize, attempts are made to reference an MDMaterial
     with an index higher than the maximum size of the MDMaterials
     
     Presumably something is screwing with the material sets passed into MD::Initialize
     and mucking up the dereferencing.
     
     In looking into that, it was necessary to find the location that the const MaterialSet*
     which is attached to he MD::Initialize task is recast to a const MaterialSubset* with
     which MD::Initialize is actually invoked.  This would appear to happen in:
     
     SchedulerCommon::compile()
     
     Currently trying to understand how that works to determine if our material sets are getting
     mangled between the two components.  (Clearly they are, but the question is how/why and
     how to fix them.)
     
     Look at TaskGraph.cc::775 to track how the MDMaterialSet* somehow ends up with the wrong data
     on becoming an MDMaterialSubset*.
     
     SIDE NOTE:  Look into lb->createNeighborhood (in TaskGraph::createDetailedTasks(...)
                 for potential ability to solve problem with sampling patches > 1 patch away
                 from current patch.
