/*
 *  ProgressiveWarning.h
 *
 *    To the best of my understanding, this class will print out a given
 *    error message based on the number of times the warning is invoked
 *    (occurs).  This depends on the settings given to the  warning object.
 *    For example:
 *
 *       ProgressiveWarning warn( msg, 10 );
 *       warn.invoke();
 *    
 *    Would print out the 1st, 10th, 100th, 1000th... etc time the warning
 *    is invoked.  A 'warn( msg, 2)' would display the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th,
 *    16th, etc.
