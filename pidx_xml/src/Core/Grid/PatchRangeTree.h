CLASS
   PatchRangeTree

   Uses the RangeTree template to make a RangeTree to be used
   to query for patches within a given range.  Used by
   Level::selectPatches.

DESCRIPTION
   The RangeTree is used to query the patches based on the
   patch centers, then each of those patches are checked using
   their dimensions to see if they are actually within the
   query range.
   
   Assuming that the average patch dimensions of the set of
   patches is not much less than the maximum patch dimensions
   the query is performed in about O(log(n)^2 + k) time where
   n is the number of patches to be searched and k is the number
   of those patches within the query.  The initialization time
   and storage space requirements are both O(n*log(n)^2).
