This directory contains simple examples ups files for the switcher component
For each example there is one master ups file that specifies what subcomponents
to run along with an input file and switching criteria.  Below are three
switcher examples, each with increasing complexity

switchExample_impm_mpm.ups
__________________________________
This master ups file runs the impm problem 
  
  inputs/IMPM/4disks_2d.1mat.ups
  
for 10 timesteps and then switches over to the mpm component and runs:
  
  inputs/MPM/4disks_2d.1mat.ups
      
both of these input files are very similar.


example2_impm_mpmice.ups
__________________________________
This master ups file runs the mpmice problem 
  
  inputs/UCF/Switcher/ex2_phase1.up 
  
for 3 timesteps and then switches over to the impm component and runs:
  
  inputs/UCF/Switcher/ex2_phase2.ups 
     
In this example the variables p.acceleration and g.externalHeatFlux are required
by the mpmice component from the old_dw.  To satisfy this we add 

  <init var = "p.acceleration"     matls = "mpm_matls"/>      
  <init var = "p.externalHeatFlux" matls = "mpm_matls"/>
      
telling the switcher to initialize these variables to 0.0 and put them
into the new_dw in the timestep immediately before the component switching takes place.


example3.ups
__________________________________
There are three phases in this example.  First the grid and mpmice
variables are setup by running 

  inputs/UCF/Switcher/ex3_phases1_3.ups

After 3 timesteps are taken an implicit mpm heat transfer calculation
begins by running the impm component with
  
  inputs/UCF/Switcher/ex3_phase2.ups.
  
The "simpleBurn" switch criteria states that if the reactant (matl 1) 
exceeds 350K then switch to the explosion phase (mpmice) or phase 3.
  
  inputs/UCF/Switcher/ex3_phases1_3.ups
  
To pass variables over from phase 1 to phase 3 we use:

    <carry_over var="press_CC" matls="0" />
    <carry_over var="temp_CC" />
    <carry_over var="rho_CC" />
    <carry_over var="sp_vol_CC" />
    <carry_over var="vel_CC" />
    <carry_over var="NC_CCweight" />
    <carry_over var="heatRate_CC" matls="0,1"/>
    <carry_over var="g.temperature" />
    
We reuse the same ups file for phases 1 & 3.


SwitchExample4.ups

This is identical to example 3 except adaptive mesh refinement is used.
The grid is refined around particles and the 'tiled' regridder is being used.
