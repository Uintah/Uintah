//  This is a standalone program (g++ partpostprocess.cc) that
//  can read in the datafiles like those created by the puda -jim1
//  option.

//  The goal is to track a subset of variables for a particular particle
//  or set of particles, in this case particles that are initially along
//  the line z=.001, y=.183.  This is done by creating a vector of
//  particleIDs associated with those particles by scanning the partout0000
//  file, and then finding the  particles with those same IDs in subsequent
//  partout* files.  This data is then printed to files.
