The Field Sub Sample module sub samples a structured grid. It is
posible to sub sample a particular region or sparsely sample the grid.
      </p>

<p> The Field Sub Sample input port is a field that is structured in
3D. This field will be sub sampled in 3D and piped to the output port. The
user can sub-sample the grid in all directions via the GUI. The
sub-sampling can be performed either of two ways, a sub region can be
selected or values can be skipped. A combination of both is also
possible. </p> 

<p> The "Start Node" defines the first sampling. Because the data is
circular in the Theta and Phi directions the ending node is defined as
the "Start Node" plus the "Number of Nodes". This allows for overlap
in the data. In the case of the Radial direction the number of nodes
is limited based on the size of the data. The "Skip Nodes" defines how
often the data will be sample between start and end nodes. </p>
