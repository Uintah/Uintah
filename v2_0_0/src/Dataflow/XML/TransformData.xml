    <summary>Perform a specified functional transform on all of the
  data in a field.</summary>
    <description>
    	<p>Compute the specified function on each data element in the
	 input field.</p>

        <p>The data transform is specified in the GUI as the body of a
	C++ function.  The input values to the function are the x, y,
	and z positions of the data point, v0 for the first field's
	data element and v1 for the second field's data element.  No
	value is returned, rather set the 'result' variable to the
	return type.  For example, "result = x + v;" would return a
	new field containing the x position of each element added with
	the value that was already there.  "result = v.x();" could be
	used to extract the x component of a vector field into a
	scalar field.</p>
