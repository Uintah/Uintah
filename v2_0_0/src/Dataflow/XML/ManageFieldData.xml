    <summary>Add and remove data from a field.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        This module performs two simultanious operations.  First
        the "Input Field" is split into it's mesh part it's data
        values.  The data values are packaged up and passed to
        the "Output Matrix" port.  Second the input field
        geometry is joined with the data from the Input Matrix,
        and the result is passed out on the "Output Field" port.
        If the input matrix is not present, then the second
        operation is not performed and the Output Field is the
        same as the Input Field.
      </p>
      <p>
        The format of the "Output Matrix" will be a column matrix
        if the nput field was of scalar type.  It will be an Nx3
        matrix if the input field contained vectors.  If the
        field contained tensors it will be Nx9 matrix, where the
        tensor is flattened out in left to right, top to bottom
        order.  Column 0 contains (0, 0), column 1 contains (0,
        1), column 2 contains (0,2), column 3 contains (1, 0),
        etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "Input Matrix" should have the same number of values
        as the field where the values are to be stored.  The type
        of the Iutput Field is preserved in the Output field as
        well.  So for instance if the input field is a vector
        field, the Output Field will also be a vector field, and
        the input matrix should be an Nx3 matrix where N is equal
        to the number of elements to be filled in.
