    <summary>Due to the specified dipoles, the DipoleInSphere module fills the sphere field with potentials values.</summary>

    <description>
      <p>Version Date: March 2001</p>
      <p>Version: 1.1</p>
      <p>The current version of the module provides analytical
	calculation of potentials on the surface of the supplied sphere. We assume that the
	sphere has uniform conductivity equal to 1. The
	center of the sphere is the center of the bounding box, and the
	radius is half of the maximum dimension of the box.</p>

	  <p>The port takes a handle to the matrix that is n-by-6 in size,
	  containing parameters of n dipoles (the first three column are dipole
	  positions, the other three are dipole moments). We also assume that the dipoles
	  lie inside the sphere. Otherwise, the moudle log window produces a warning message.</p>
