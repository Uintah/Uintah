How does one install the thirdparty software on an SGI Octane.
When running the install script provided in the tar ball from the SCIRun
website, the following error message appears.  It seems to be trying to copy a
xerces file that does not exist.

</question>

<answer>
<para>
Xerces creates long commands for a shell.  Perhaps the
value of the system's 'ncargs' variable is too small.
</para>

<para>
Run the command 'systune ncargs'.  It will report ncargs' value. Use
the systune command to set ncargs to a large value: systune ncargs
262144.  Root privilages are needed to do this.  Try the thirdparty
install again.

<question> 
<para>
SCIRun and its required thirdparty
software is successfully installed (by hand) onto an SGI target install machine, but
SCIRun is runs, it immediately signals an abort (SIGABRT).

</literallayout>
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
One or more of the thirdparty libraries is configured and built to
use (i.e. link against) pthreads.  On SGI machines, SCIRun uses sproc
threads instead of pthreads.  It is illegal to use both sproc and 
pthreads in a single process.  When two binaries are linked together
into a single process at runtime (e.g. scirun and libxerces-c1_4.so),
an abort is signalled and the process is shutdown.
</para>

<para>
The solution is to rebuild the offending libraries, configuring them
to _not_ use threads.  Xerces is typically the offending library,
although Tcl and others may also be incorrectly configured to use
threads.  See the <ulink
url="../Installation/Guide/thirdparty.html">Thirdparty Software
Installation and Build Information</ulink> for recommended configure
arguments for thirdparty software.  Note that when the automatic
install script is used, all software is automatically configured
and built correctly.

<question>
<para>
When building SCIRun on an SGI target machine, an error
message regarding the SGI Image Format Library (IFL) appeared.
</para>
<para>
The error text looks similar to this:
<literallayout class="monospaced">
ld64: FATAL   9  : I/O error (-lifl): No such file or directory
</literallayout>
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
The problem is a bug within the SCIRun build system that requires
the SGI Image Format Library (IFL) in order to make SCIRun.  The long
term solution is to make the IFL optional instead of required.
</para>
<para>
For now, work around the problem by having the
system administrator install the IFL onto the target install machine.
Be sure to install the type (32 or 64 bit) needed for SCIRun
configuration(s).

<question>
<para>
SCIRun sometimes hangs when running the example nets on a dual
processor linux machine.
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
This is a known bug with no known solution.  There is,
however, a workaround:
</para>
<para>
Re-configure SCIRun adding the --disable-sci-malloc option to
the configure command, then rebuild SCIRun.  If SCIRun still 
hangs while running example nets, change directories to
on-the-fly-libs and issue a make command by hand.  Run the
example again once the make of the on-the-fly-libs finishes.

<para>
Installing SCIRun or the thirdparty software into 
my home directory fails when building.
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
When installing any of the software into your home directory be sure
to use complete and absolute paths when providing configure argumenst.
<emphasis>Do not</emphasis> use tilde expansion or any other short
cuts. They will not properly expand by the install scripts and
makefiles.
</para>
<para>
For example, instead of configuring with
<option>--prefix=~bob</option>, configure with
<option>--prefix=/home/bob</option>.

<question>
<para>
How does one make a 64 bit build of SCIRun?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
64 bit is only available on the SGI platform.  To
build a 64 bit version of SCIRun, 64
bit versions of the thirdparty software are needed.  Use the SCI thirdparty install script using the 64
option.  If building by hand, see advice below.
</para>
<para>
Once the thirdparty software is available in 64 bits, 
configure
SCIRun with the <option>--enable-64bit</option> option and rebuild.
</para>
<para>
Unfortunately, most of the required third party software do not take
64 bit SGI platforms into account when writing configure scripts and
makefiles. However, it is possible to build all 
software in 64 bit. In general, to get 64 bit versions of the third
party software, it is necessary to edit Makefiles so that 
<varname>CFLAGS</varname> and <varname>LFLAGS</varname> macros have
<quote>-64</quote> listed instead of <quote>-n32</quote>. In the case
of tcl distributions, edit makefiles (after
configuring) by hand and replace all instances of
<quote>-n32</quote> with <quote>-64</quote>. For Xerces, 
change the environment variables listed above, replacing all
instances of <quote>-n32</quote> with <quote>-64</quote> before
configuring.  </para>

<question>  
<para>
SCIRun is successfully installed onto a linux target install
machine with XFree86 version 4.1.0 installed, but when it runs,
it immediately signals a segmentation violation (SIGSEGV):
<literallayout class="monospaced">
Thread "main"(pid 2063) caught signal SIGSEGV at address 0xdccc10

</para>  
</question>

<answer>
<para>
The XFree86 version 4.1.0 binary distributions for linux ship with a
version of GLU (libGLU.so.1.3) conflicts with the xerces
library. Replace the GLU library with a different
version (e.g. libMesaGLU.so, or some other GLU already on the
machine).
