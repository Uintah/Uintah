    <title>Dynamic Compilation</title>

    
      <para>
      This chapter introduces the concept of <firstterm>Dynamic
      Compilation</firstterm> within SCIRun.
    </para>
    

    <section>
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>
      SCIRun makes extensive use of C++ templates.  Templates are a
      powerful mechanism that allows writing algorithms or data
      structures once, while allowing them to be usable with many
      types of data.  However, in order to use any particular type of
      data, the templates need to know about them at compile time.
      Dynamic compilation allows templates written in
      the past to be applied to new data types at run time by
      dynamically compiling code.
    </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Disclosure</title>

      <para>
       The Disclosure directory contains objects that discover information 
       about types, as well as objects that produce previously uncompiled
       types.
    </para>

      <para>
       This directory also contains the TypeDescription object, as well
       as the DynamicLoader. TypeDescription gives a recursive definition 
       of type at runtime.  One can query a string that indicates the type
       from the this object. It also provides information that can by used 
       by the DynamicLoader to compile types that support TypeDescription.
    </para>
      
      <para>
       The DynamicLoader writes a .cc file, compiles it, then loads in the .so
       all at runtime.  The main function is to compile algorithms that are
       templated on various field types in SCIRun. This gives SCIRun a minimal
       set of template instantiation based on how a user happens to use 
       SCIRun, as opposed to the combinatorial explosion of template bloat 
       that is the alternative.
    </para>

    <section>
      <title>Programming with SCIRun dynamic compilation</title>
      <para>
      A developer is likely to use this code from within modules that 
      has a field port. A FieldHandle can be one of *many* types of fields.
      An algorithm can be templated on the field, and use the DynamicLoader 
      to manage compilation and loading of the algorithm without the 
      module code ever needing to know the exact type of the field.
    </para>
      <para>
       The main use of code in this directory is to compile and load 
       templated algorithms for use in modules.
    </para>

      <section>
	<title>get_type_description()</title>

	<para>
        There are many of these functions.  Each is overloaded on the type that
        the returned TypeDescription supports. There must be one of these if
        your type is to be supported in dynamic compilation.
      </para>
	<para>
        An example of a simple get_type_description for int.
      </para>
	<programlisting>
       const TypeDescription* get_type_description(int*)
       {
       	 static TypeDescription* td = 0;
       	 static string nm("int");
       	 static string path("builtin");
       	 if(!td){
       	   td = scinew TypeDescription(nm, path);
       	 }
       	 return td;
       }
      </programlisting>
	<para>
        An example of a templated get_type_description function.
      </para>
	<programlisting>
       template &lt;class T &gt;
       const TypeDescription* get_type_description(vector &lt;T &gt;*)
       {
         static TypeDescription* td = 0;
         static string v("vector");
         static string path("std::vector"); 
         if(!td){
           const TypeDescription *sub = SCIRun::get_type_description((T*)0);
           TypeDescription::td_vec *subs = scinew TypeDescription::td_vec(1);
           (*subs)[0] = sub;
           td = scinew TypeDescription(v, subs, path);
         }
         return td;
       }
