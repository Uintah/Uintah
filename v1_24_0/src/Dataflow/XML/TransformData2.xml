    <summary>Perform a specified functional transform to each pair of
  data elements in the two input fields.</summary>
    <description>

	<p>Compute the specified function for each pair of
        corresponding data elements in the input fields.  In order to
        correspond the data points, this module requires that the two
        input fields share the same mesh and have their data at the
        same location.</p>
  
        <p>The data transform is specified in the GUI as the body of a
	C++ function.  The input values to the function are the x, y,
	and z positions of the data point, v0 for the first field's
	data element and v1 for the second field's data element.  No
	value is returned, rather set the 'result' variable to the
	return type.  For example, "result = v0 + v1;" would add each
	of the corresponding elements of the two fields.</p>

<title>TransformData2 Regression Test</title>

<p>Demonstrate usage of the TransformData2 module.  First a cyclone data
set is created by resampling a LatVolField onto a PointCloud and then using
<modref package="SCIRun" name="TransformData"/> to assign vectors to that PointCloud using a cylindrical
mapping.  A scalar field containing the x position of
each point in the PointCloud is also created.  The two PointCloudField
data sets are then merged using TransformData by recreating a vector
for each point in the PointCloud that contains the direction of the
input vector field and the magnitude of the input scalar field.
Finally this merged field is visualized using <modref package="SCIRun" name="ShowField"/>.</p>
