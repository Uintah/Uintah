    <summary>
    The ColorMap Read a persistent colormap from a file on disk.
    </summary>
    <description>
    <p>
    A ColorMap maps scalar values to color values. Upon opening, the 
    ColorMapReader GUI defaults to the directory that the user sets for their 
    SCIRUN_DATA environment variable.  Otherwise, the GUI will default to the 
    directory where the user's SCIRun executable resides. The current directory 
    defaults to only show files with an .cmap extension which helps the user 
    determine the difference between ColorMaps and other files.  However, the 
    ColorMapReader can read-in a file with any extension so long as the data 
    has the correct format.  If the user attempts to read-in a file that is 
    other than a SCIRun supported ColorMap, or uses an incorrect file format, 
    an error message appears in the Error frame within the SCIRun enrvironment. 
    Clicking the OK button will load the file and dismiss the GUI.
