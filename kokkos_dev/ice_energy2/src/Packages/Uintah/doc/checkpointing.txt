Information about using checkpoint/restart capabilities of sus.

Checkpointing:

To checkpoint your sus run, put a "checkpoint" tag in the DataArchiver
section of your input file.  This tag should have an "interval"
attribute and optionally a "cycle" attribute.  The "interval" attribute
works just the same as <outputInterval>, telling it how often to save
checkpoint data.  The "cycle" attribute tells it how many checkpointed
timesteps to store at a time (before "recycling").  cycle=2 is the
default.  You should have cycle >= 2 in order to prevent a program crash
from causing you to lose your checkpoint (in other words, keep a
checkpoint as backup).

Here is an example:
 <checkpoint interval="0.01" cycle="2"/>

I've also committed a checkpointing version of disk.ups as an example.

Restarting:

To restart from a checkpointed archive, simply put "-restart" in your
sus command-line arguments and specify the .uda directory where you have
your checkpointed data as input instead of a ups file (it reads the
copied input.ups from the archive).  You can optionally specify a
certain timestep to restart from with "-t <timestep>" if you have
multiple checkpoints, but the last checkpointed timestep is the
default.  When you restart, it copies all of the appropriate stuff from
the old uda directory to its new uda directory.  If you don't want to
keep the old uda directory around, you can specify "-nocopy" to have it
be removed (i.e. if you are cramped for disk space).  Either way it
creates a new uda directory for you as always.

Here are some example:
./sus -mpm -restart disks.uda.000 -nocopy
./sus -mpm -restart disks.uda.000 -t 29
