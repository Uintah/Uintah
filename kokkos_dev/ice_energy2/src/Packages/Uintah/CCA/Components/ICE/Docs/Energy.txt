The Thermo directory contains models

The primitive variables are internal energy and specific volume.
Temperature, viscosity, specific heats, gamma and thermal conductivity
are derived from those variables.  Some models may have other state
that affect these values as well (such as species concentrations).


Energy goes through the following state changes:

react       m_0 -> m_L  (reaction at constant energy and volume)
compute ThermoA (int_eng_0, sp_vol_0, m_L)
computeEquilibrationPressure (int_eng_0, sp_vol_0, m_L)   -> sp_vol_eq           (needs ThermoA)
compute ThermoB (int_eng_0, sp_vol_eq, m_L)
accumulateEnergySourceSinks (needs ThermoB)
computeLagrangianSpecificVolume (int_eng_0, sp_vol_eq, m_L)  -> sp_vol_L    (needs ThermoB)
addExchangeToMomentumAndEnergy (int_eng_0, sp_vol_1, m_1), (int_eng_L, sp_vol_1  (needs Thermo?? and Thermo???)
advect   m_L -> m_1, int_eng_L -> int_eng_1, sp_vol_L -> sp_vol_1
compute ThermoD(int_eng_1, sp_vol_1, m_1)
computeStableTimestep (int_eng_1, sp_vol_1, m_1)



where m_0 and m_1 are the old and new model state variables,
