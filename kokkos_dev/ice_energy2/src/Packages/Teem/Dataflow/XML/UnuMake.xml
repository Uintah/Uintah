    <summary>Create a nrrd (or nrrd header) from scratch. The data can
be in one or more files, or coming from stdin. This provides an easy
way of providing the bare minimum information about some data so as to
wrap it in a nrrd, either to pass on for further unu processing, or to
save to disk. However, with -h , this creates only a detached nrrd
header file, without ever reading or writing data. When reading
multiple files, each file must contain the data for one slice along
the slowest axis. Nearly all the options below refer to the finished
nrrd resulting from joining all the slices together, with the
exception of -ls , -bs , and -e , which apply to every input slice
file. When reading data from many seperate files, it may be easier to
put their filenames in a response file; there can be one or more
filenames per line of the response file.</summary>

      <p>Write Header : Check to write out a .nhdr file.  This file
can be specified by browsing to it by clicking the Specify Header File
button.</p>
      <p>Kind : Specify the kind of the first axis. Other axes kinds
may be set using <modref package="Teem" name="UnuAxinfo"/>.</p>
      <p>Size : Specify the sizes separated by a single space.  This
indicates the number of samples along each axis.</p>
      <p>Spacing : These float values will indicate the spacing
between samples. These should be separated by white space.</p>
      <p>Labels : Short string labels for each axis.  These labels
should be separated by a space.</p>
      <p>Content :Specifies the content string of the nrrd, which is
built upon by many nrrd function to record a history of
operations.</p>
      <p>Line Skip : number of ascii lines to skip before reading
data</p>
      <p>Byte Skip : number of bytes to skip (after skipping ascii
lines, if any) before reading data. Can use -bs -1 to skip a binary
header of unknown length in raw-encoded data.</p>
      <p>Endoding :output file format. Possibilities include raw,
ascii, text, hex.</p>
      <p>Endianness : Endianness of data; relevent for any data with
value representation bigger than 8 bits, with a non-ascii encoding:
little for Intel and friends; big for everyone else. Defaults to
endianness of this machine.</p>
      <p>Kev Value Pairs : key/value string pairs to be stored in
nrrd. Each key/value pair must be a single string.</p>
