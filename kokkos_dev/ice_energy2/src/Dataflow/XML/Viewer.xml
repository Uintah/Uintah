    <summary>The Viewer displays interactive graphical output to the
computer screen. Use the Viewer to see a geometry, or spatial data.
The Viewer provides access to many simulation parameters and controls,
thus, indirectly initiates new iterations of the simulation steps
important to computational steering.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>Autoview restores the display back to a default condition.
This is very useful when objects disappear from the view window due to
a combination of settings. 
      </p>
      <p>Set Home View captures the setting of the current view so you
can return to it later by clicking the "Go home" button.
      </p>
      <p>Go home restores the current home view.
      </p>
      <p>Views lists a number of standard viewing angles and
orientations. The view directions align with the Cartesian axes of the
objects. The ``Up vector'' choice sets the orientation of the objects
when viewed along the selected axis.
      </p> 
      <p>From the Viewer window, the left corner of the control panel
contains performance indicators that document the current rendering
speed for the display. More advanced graphics performance results in a
higher drawing rate.
      </p>
      <p> A small plus sign (``+'') appears in the lower right corner
of the Viewer window. Clicking on the plus sign reveals the extended
control panel.
