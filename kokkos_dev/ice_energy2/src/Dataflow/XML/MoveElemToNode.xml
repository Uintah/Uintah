    <summary>Make a new field with data at nodes instead of
elements.</summary>
    <description>

      <p>MoveElemToNode creates a new field with the data at the mesh
nodes rather than at the elements.  This currently only works on
LatVolField, StructHexVolField, ImageField, and StuctQuadSurfField
field types.  The data must be at cells/faces as appropriate to the
field type.  A new field is created such that the data remains at the
same positions in space but occupy the nodes of the new mesh rather
than being located at the cell/face locations.  This is the opposite
of <modref package="SCIRun" name="MoveNodeToElem"/>.</p>

      <p>Test the MoveElemToNode module by moving the data in an
ImageField from the faces onto the nodes while retaining the same data

are better tested.</p>
