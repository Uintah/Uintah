<h2>
Specification procedure</h2></center>

<p><br>Our goal is to have complete specifications for each module we release.
To achieve this goal you will need to create and completely populate a
.xml file that lives next to the .cc file associated with a module. 

<br>&nbsp;</br>
<dt>
<b>spec.xml</b></dt>

<dd>
Combined with the documentation extracted via Cocoon, spec.xml defines
a complete specification for a module. It contains information the compile
needs, as well as various levels of documentation targeted at different
user levels. Documentation will be extracted from the module's .xml file, and the
.xml file is intended to be maintained just as the C++ code is.</dd>

<h3>
User levels</h3>

<dt>
<b>user</b></dt>

<dd>
User who works with a predefined network map of modules. This level of user is
not relevant for module level specifications, and nothing in the spec.xml is 
targeted toward this kind of user. These users will have a unique User
Guide for the specific PSE network(s) they use.</dd>
<br>&nbsp;</br>

<dt>
<b>builder</b></dt>

<dd>
User will do the above as well as building and editing their own maps,
but will write no code. Some of the information in the spec.xml is
germane to this type of user. </dd>
<br>&nbsp;</br>

<dt>
<b>developer</b></dt>

<dd>
User will write modules they need as well as all of the above. Much of
the information in the spec.xml is important to this type of user.</dd>
<br>&nbsp;</br>

<h3>
Steps:</h3></center>

<ol>
<li>
Start with .cc file.&nbsp; Make sure it conforms to the <a href="http://www.csafe.utah.edu/development_environment/coding_standards/index.html">coding
standard</a>.</li>
<br>&nbsp;</br>
<li>
If there isn't one there already, create a ./doc subdirectory in the directory where the module lives.
All the files you generate besides <i>module_name</i>.xml belong in the doc directory so that
the source tree doesn't get too cluttered.</li>
<br>&nbsp;</br>
<li>
Update/enhance <a href="http://www.csafe.utah.edu/development_environment/cocoon/index.html">cocoon
style comments</a>.</li>
<br>&nbsp;</br>
<li>
Take a screen shot of the gui (if it has one) and convert to gif format.
This should be placed in ./doc and needs a particular name:
Name the image <i>module_name</i>Gui.gif. 
<br>&nbsp;</br>
use xv for generating grabbing the image,
it will grab the whole GUI popup dialog, and just the dialog.&nbsp; If you need more
than one window in the grab, and you are on an SGI use snapshot, then xv
to convert to gif format.</li>
<br>&nbsp;</br>

<li>
Write <i>module_name</i>.xml.&nbsp; It should live in the same dir as the .cc file. See
the <a href="anotSpec.html">annotated spec.xml </a>to understand what each
tag is for. 
<br>&nbsp;</br>
We recommend that you use emacs to edit the .xml file. If you are using 
emacs, there is an xml mode you can use which knows about xml and enforces the 
syntax so you can't mess up as easily. <a href="psgml.html">obtain the xml editing 
mode for emacs</a>, and <a href="spec.dtd">obtain the spec.dtd file</a> that 
makes this editing mode useful.</li>
<br>&nbsp;</br>
<a name="bugzilla">Bugzilla! One part of the spec is listing the bugs associated with this module.
To find the known bugs for this module, go to the 
<a href="http://www.csafe.utah.edu/bugzilla/query.cgi">Bugzilla bug reporting page</a>, 
On the upper left choose <br><b> Status</b> =NEW or ASSIGNED or REOPENED (highlight all 3). 
Scroll to the bottom and
choose <br><b> Program</b> =PSECommon (assuming your Module is located in PSECommon), 
<br><b> Version</b> =1.0, <br><b> Component</b> =PSE, 
<br><b> Description </b> = <i>module_name</i> <br>Leave the rest of the fields blank
(they serve to limit the query further). Then submit the query. All
unresolved bugs are game. To double check the status of a bug (since bugzilla tends to be somewhat
out of date), send the bug owner an email (and tell them to please update bugzilla while you're
at it).    </a></li>
<br>&nbsp;</br>
<li>
The current plan is to gmake docs: generate Specification in the various
formats (xml, html, latex) This is not currently implemented, so <b><u><font color="#993300">do
not do this step.</font></u></b>.</li>
<br>&nbsp;</br>
<li>
Update the repository. Commit the changes you made to the .h, .cc, and .tcl files for this
module. Add the files you created to the cvs repository
 (<i>module_name</i>.xml  and all the other <i>module_name</i>*.*
files in the ./doc directory). If you had to create the ./doc directory, you will also have to 
create it in the cvs source tree before checking in the files underneath it.
