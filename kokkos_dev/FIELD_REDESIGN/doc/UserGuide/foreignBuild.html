<H2> This document describes how to build the PSE on a machine outside
of the Computer Science Department</H2>

To build the PSE on a non-CS machine, you will need to follow these
steps:

<B>(These instructions are only valid on SGI's.)</B>

<OL>
  <LI> Check out the PSE using cvs by following these instructions:
     ?????where are the instructions for checking out the PSE????

  <LI> You will need the following:

    <OL><LI> autoconf
        <LI> itcltk

	  <OL>
	    <LI> Get the itcltk files from "here"
	    <LI> Determine where you want them to reside. 
	      <OL>
	        <LI> In a system wide directory (useful if you have 
		multiple people on the same system (or same shared file
		system) who will be using these files.
	        <LI> In a personal directory (useful if you do not have
		root privileges and thus cannot put them in a system
		wide location.)
              </OL>

	    <LI> Create a directory named "itcltk8.0.4" at that location
	         and move the files there.

	    <LI> Create a symbolic link from /tmp/opt/itcltk8.0.4 to the
	    	   actual location you put the files.  (eg: ln -s
		   /home/dav/itcltk8.0.4 /tmp/opt/itcltk8.0.4).
          </OL>

	<LI> Many systems automatically clean the /tmp directory.  If
	   you system does so, then put in the following (or similar if
	   you do not use a csh) in your .cshrc file (The /home/dav
	   should be replaced with the actual location of the itcltk
	   directory:
	   <BR>
	   <PRE>
	   if ( ! -e /tmp/opt ) then
              mkdir /tmp/opt
           endif
           if ( ! -e /tmp/opt/itcltk8.0.4 ) then
	      ln -s /home/dav/itcltk8.0.4 /tmp/opt/itcltk8.0.4
           end if
	   </PRE>
      </OL>

   <LI> xerces

     <OL>
        <LI> Get the xerces (XML parser) software from here:
	<LI> Uncompress it.
	<LI> Un-tar it (<I>tar -xvf xerces.tar</I>) in either a system
	   wide or a local directory (see b.2 above.)
        <LI> Edit the "configure" script in ./PSE/src and replace
	   /home/sci/sparker with the location you put the xerces
	   software on your machine.
     </OL>

   <LI> globus

  <LI> Use "configure" to build the Makefiles for the PSE.
    <OL>
      <LI> cd ./PSE/src
      <LI> configure --enable-debug --enable-package=Uintah
    </OL>
  <LI> Use "gmake" to compile the PSE.
    <OL>
      <LI> cd ./PSE/src
      <LI> gmake -j2   # The -j2 tells make to use 2 processors.
      Adjust this number based on the number of processors you have on
      your machine.
    </OL>
</OL>
