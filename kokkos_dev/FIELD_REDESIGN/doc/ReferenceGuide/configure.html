  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-package=&lt;package_name&gt; <BR>
    <td>&lt;package_name&gt; should be one (or more) of: 
           Uintah, SCIRun, BioPSE, DaveW, Yarden, Kurt, Phil.
           ( eg: --enable-package="Uintah SCIRun" )
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-exename=NAME
    <td>call the executable NAME instead of the default 'pse'
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-debug
    <td>Turn on debugging.  This adds the -g flag to compiles.  To
        use something else besides -g, use --enable-debug="-myflags"
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-optimize
    <td>Turn on optimization.  This adds the -O2 flag to
        compiles.  To use something else besides -O2,
        use --enable-optimize="-myflags"
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-enterleave
    <td>enable the annoying "Entering directory..." and
        "Leaving directory..." messages from make, which help
        emacs find the errors from the compile output.
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-64bit
    <td>compile in 64 bit mode instead of in 32 bit mode.   Available
        on the following platforms: Irix
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-threads=IMPL
    <td>Set the thread implementation to IMPL.  pthreads is the
        default, except on irix.  You can use --enable-threads=pthreads
        to get pthreads support on Irix.
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-assertion-level=N
    <td>set the assertion level to N (default=3).  Assertion level 0 is no
        assertions (fastest), level 1 is few assertions, level 2 is most
        assertions, and level 3 is all assertions, including array
        bounds checking (slowest).
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-parallel
    <td>Compile the new distributed memory parallel PSE.  This is
        very experimental and may break many things.  It is also a
        much different world.
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--enable-globus=DIR
    <td>Use the globus installation in DIR.  Only applicatble
        with the --enable-parallel option.
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--with-tcl=DIR
    <td>Use the tcl installation in DIR, where DIR is the location
        of the /lib, /bin and /include dirs for tcl8.0.4, tk8.0.4,
        itcl/itk3.0 and blt2.4.
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>--with-xerces=DIR
    <td>Use the xerces-c library file (libxerces-c1_1.so or libxerces-c1_2.so)
        located in DIR.
  </tr>

A typical configuration would be:<p>

<code><ul>
./configure --enable-debug --enable-enterleave 
            --enable-package="Uintah SCIRun"
</ul></code><p>
