Gui and Help files have moved to a common location:

PSECommon/
	*.tcl
	help/
		*.html

A number of files in Geom have been renames to make the file name
match the class name. 

eg:

   Geom   ->  GeomObj
   Arrows ->  GeomArrows
   Text   ->  GeomText



A number of often used routines have been moved from Classlib to:

Util:
	NotFinished 

TCL has been renamed TclInterface.

Most namespace names are the same as the directory where the files
reside.  However, there are a few exceptions due to class/namespace
name conflicts:

   Persistent -> PersistentSpace
   Geom       -> GeomSpace


Datatypes has been renamed:  CommonDatatypes

Template .cc files are to be moved into their .h file.
