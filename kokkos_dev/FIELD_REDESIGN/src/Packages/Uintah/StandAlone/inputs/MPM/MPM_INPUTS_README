This is a brief description of the input files in inputs/MPM:

disks.ups  This is the standard disks problem which we've been running
since the first MPM code.  Excercises CompMooneyRivlin Constitutive
Model.

disksel.ups Same as disks.ups except the CompNeoHook constitutive
model is used.

disksplas.ups Same as disks.ups except the CompNeoHookPlas constitutive
model is used.

diskshypo.ups Same as disks.ups except the HypoElastic constitutive
model is used.

disksvs.ups Disks problem for ViscoScram.  This is a much more resolved
calculation than the standard disks problems, and is actually a pretty big
run (24 hr.s on 4 processors).

disks_4patch.ups Same as disks.ups except that it uses 4 patches to solve
the problem.  Should give identical answers to disks.ups.

disks2mat.ups This differs from disks.ups in that each disk is a separate
velocity field and they interact via the friction contact algorithm.

disks2mat4patch.ups Same as disks2mat.ups except that it uses 4 patches.
Should give identical answers to disks2mat.ups

heatcond.ups  Problem to test heat conduction in a bar, with one side
hot, one side cold.  They should go to equilibrium over time.

heatcond2mat.ups  Same as heatcond.ups, but uses separate 
materials, and thus temperature fields for the hot and cold sides.
This exercises the thermal contact algorithm.

inclined_plane_sphere.ups  Sphere rolling down and inclined plane.
This exercises the frictional contact algorithm.  X-position in
CenterOfMassPosition.dat should compare well with the function
17408.*(2.+2.525*t**2), where t is time.

twomatburn.ups  Two adjacent materials, one burnable, the other inert.
The first starts at 0 degrees, the latter at 100.  The second material
is next to a 300 degree wall, as heat conducts through it, and into
the first material, via the thermal contact algorithm, the first material
ignites and burns away.

Bigger runs:

10grains.ups 10 stationary grains compacted by a heavy rectangular 
piston with an initial velocity of .01 cm/us = 100 m/s. Frictional
contact between grains.  Discretized into 8000 cells, 27000 particles.

1000grains.ups 999 stationary grains compacted by a heavy rectangular 
piston with an initial velocity of .01 cm/us = 100 m/s. Frictional
contact between grains.  Discretized into 64000 cells, 400000 particles.

1000grains_svcontact.ups  Same as 1000grains, but uses single velocity
field contact algorithm.

1000grains_2m_svcontact.ups  Same geometry as 1000grains, but has all grains
one material (velocity field) and the piston a second material.  Uses
single velocity field contact algorithm

What to Expect:

There is a bit of a problem in that correctness is only somewhat
rigorous.  The dat files are generally the most useful, but all the
plotting routines I've used require you to strip out the brackets in
CenterOfMassPosition.dat and CenterOfMassVelocity.dat, where each row 
of data is:
time [Vector.x() Vector.y() Vector.z()].

The disks problem is a collision problem.  For those one would expect
the momemta of the individual disks to change sign and have the same
or reduced in magnitude after the collision.  The default output
(CenterOfMassVelocity.dat) is the sum for both disks, so that should
be approximately zero.  During the collision the kinetic energy should
drop as the disks come to rest and then increase again.  The strain
energy should spike during collision.  Total Mass should be conserved.
All the different disks inputs will give somewhat different results
except for a) disks and disks_4patch and b) disks2mat and
disks2mat4patch, which should be identical to machine precision.

The heat conduction problems pretty much require firing up the pse and
looking at temperature contours.  For these one side is hot, the other
cold, and over time the temperatures should become more uniform.  It's
not useful to look at the dat files for these, as far as I know
(expect possibly for TotalMass, which should be constant).

The inclined_plane_sphere problem is a sphere rolling down an inclined
plane.  The CenterOfMassPostion.dat should be parabolic, see the
readme file in inputs/MPM.  TotalMass should be constant.

For twomatburn, I think you want to fire up the pse and look at
particle masses.  For this case TotalMass should be decreasing.

10grains and 1000grains run, at least serially.  They are much bigger
runs, that can be submitted for MPI runs to test efficiency.  The
basic idea in both is that a piston (flat plate) compresses a box full
of spheres, and that can be seen plotting particles with the pse, but
give yourself plenty of wait time.
