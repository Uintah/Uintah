******** NRRD_INDEX(i,x,I,L,t)
**
** READ CAREFULLY!!
**
** Utility for mapping a floating point x in given range [i,I] to the
** index of an array with L elements, AND SAVES THE INDEX INTO GIVEN
** VARIABLE t, WHICH MUST BE OF TYPE INT (or long int, etc) because
** this relies on the implicit cast.  ALSO, t must be of a type large
** enough to hold ONE GREATER than L.  So you can't pass a variable
** of type unsigned char if L is 256
**
** DOES NOT DO BOUNDS CHECKING: given an x which is not inside [i,I],
** this will produce an index not inside [0,L].  The mapping is
** accomplished by dividing the range from i to I into L intervals,
** all but the last of which is half-open; the last one is closed.
** For example, the number line from 0 to 3 would be divided as
** follows for a call with i = 0, I = 4, L = 4:
**
** index:       0    1    2    3 = L-1
** intervals: [   )[   )[   )[    ]
**            |----|----|----|----|
** value:     0    1    2    3    4
**
** The main point of the diagram above is to show how I made the
** arbitrary decision to orient the half-open interval, and which
** end has the closed interval.
**
** Note that NRRD_INDEX(0,3,4,4,t) and NRRD_INDEX(0,4,4,4,t) both set t = 3
**
** The reason that this macro requires a argument for saving the
** result is that this is the easiest way to avoid extra conditionals.
** Otherwise, we'd have to do some check to see if x is close enough
** to I so that the generated index would be L and not L-1.  "Close
** enough" because due to precision problems you can have an x < I
** such that (x-i)/(I-i) == 1.  Simplest to just do the index generation
** and then do a hack to see if the index is too large by 1.
