<h1>TBONP</h1>

<b>Description:</b><p>

<a href="template.html">Template class</a> (Please read!)<p>

Parallel implementation of the Temporal Branch-on-Need Octree (T-BON) 
for rectilinear scalar fields (see the thesis for more details).<p>

Some preprocessing must be done before isosurface extraction.
This preprocess step is DIFFERENT from that of the
<a href="bono.html">BONO</a> module, but the SAME as that for
the <a href="tbon.html">TBON</a> module.  See that documentation
for details.

During execution (run the module on an execution metafile), the
user controls isovalue and time value sliders.  Nodes and data are read
in whenever needed to construct the current isosurface, otherwise
left on disk.  The data files are read in in blocks to improve I/O
performance (again, see the thesis).  A Marching Cubes-type 
interpolation is performed to create triangles for rendering.<p>

A centralized work queue model is used to distribute computation.
First, the tree and data for the current isosurface are read into memory.
Then, the tree is traversed and all cells containing portions of the
isosurface are enqueued.  Threads then request jobs and are given
batches of cells on which to perform interpolation and triangle 
construction. <p>

The number of worker threads is hard coded.  This is because I didn't
want to deal with recreating the work queue and forking more threads
whenever the user changed
the "# processors" slider.  So if you want to change it, just look in
TbonP.cc for "np = " and change that number.<p>

<p><b>Metafile format:</b><p>

Same as for the <a href="tbon.html#metafiles">TBON</a> module.
