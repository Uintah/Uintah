<h3> Arrow Widget Help </h3>

The Arrow Widget consists of a sphere with a cylinder extending from
it.  At the end of the cylinder is a cone.  The primary use of the
Arrow Widget is for specifying the seedpoint of an isosurface growing
algorithm, where the arrow will be pointed along the normal to the
isosurface at that point and the length of the arrow could indicate
curvature of the isosurface.<p>

The user moves the Arrow Widget by dragging any of its graphical
components.<p>
