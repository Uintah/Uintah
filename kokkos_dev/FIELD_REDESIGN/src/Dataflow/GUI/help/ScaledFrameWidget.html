<h3> ScaledFrame Widget Help </h3>

The ScaledFrame Widget consists of the Frame Widget with a short
cylindrical "slider" on two of the four long cylindrical sides.  These
two sides are orthogonal.  The primary use of the ScaledFrame Widget
is to set the <b>u</b> and <b>v</b> densities of streamlines emerging
from its edges or from throughout its surface.<p>

The new "slider" cylinders may be dragged along the cylindrical sides,
but not off of them or past their ends.  The distances along the
cylindrical sides is then used to get the densities.  The rest is as
on the Frame Widget.<p>
