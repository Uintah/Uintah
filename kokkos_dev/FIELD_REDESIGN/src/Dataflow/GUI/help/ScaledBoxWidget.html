<h3> ScaledBox Widget Help </h3>

The ScaledBox Widget consists of the Box Widget with a short
cylindrical "slider" on three of the twelve long cylindrical sides.
These three sides are orthogonal.  The primary use of the Scaled Box
Widget is to set the <b>u</b>, <b>v</b>, and <b>w</b> densities of
vector arrows within its interior.  When the widget is used in this
manner it is referred to as a "hedgehog."<p>

The new "slider" cylinders may be dragged along the cylindrical sides,
but not off of them or past their ends.  The distances along the
cylindrical sides is then used to get the densities.  The rest is as
on the Box Widget.<p>
