<h3> Gauge Widget Help </h3>

The Gauge Widget consists of two spheres connected by a cylinder with
a small cylindrical "slider" on the longer cylinder.  There are also
small "resize" cylinders extending from the spheres.  The primary use
of the Gauge Widget is to set the density of streamlines emerging from
the long cylinder.  It may also be used as a 3D "slider" or as a
source for a stream surface.<p>

If either sphere is dragged, the other sphere is dragged along to
maintain the length of the gauge.  If the "slider" cylinder is
dragged, it cannot move off of the long cylinder or past its ends.
The distance ratio of the "slider" along the long cylinder is used to
compute density.  If the long cylinder is dragged, the whole widget
moves, maintaining their relative placements.  Finally, if either of
the resize cylinders is dragged, the length and the small cylinder
moves to stay on the long cylinder and to maintain its previous
distance ratio along the long cylinder.<p>
