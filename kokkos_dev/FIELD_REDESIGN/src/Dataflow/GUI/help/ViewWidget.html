<h3> View Widget Help </h3>

The View Widget consists of an eye point, a "look at" point, and an up
point (encompassing the up vector and the field of view).  There is
also a geometric representation of the viewing frustrum defined by the
interface components.  The primary use of the View Widget is to
specify a camera view from within the data space--this is useful for
producing animations and for better understanding and defining a view
which is then shown in another window.<p>

The user can independently adjust the eye point, the up vector, the
field of view, the front clipping plane, and the back clipping plane
(also the "look at" point).<p>
