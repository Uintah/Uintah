<h3> Frame Widget Help </h3>

The Frame Widget consists of four cylinders connected in a rectangular
arrangement.  In the middle of each of the cylinders there is a
sphere.  There is a resize cylinder extending from each sphere.  The
primary uses of the Frame Widget are for stream volumes, for image
plane definition, and as a "tie dye" as with the Ring Widget above.<p>

If the user drags a sphere, the widget is rotated about its center
without changing the position of the center.  If a resize cylinder is
changed, the appropriate side of the Frame Widget will be extended
without changing orientation.  If a cylinder is dragged, the entire
widget moves without changing its orientation.<p>
