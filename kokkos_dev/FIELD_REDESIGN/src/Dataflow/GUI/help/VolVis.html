<title> SCIRun Help:Modules:Visualization:IsoSurface </title>

<h1> <a href = "../../../help/scirun.html">SCIRun Help</a> </h1>
<h2> <a href = "../../help/Modules.html">General Module Help</a> </h2>
<h3> <a href = "Visualization.html">Visualization Category Help</a> </h3>
<h4> Purpose </h4>

The VolVis module performs volume visualization using the
technique described in Marc Levoy's 1988 paper "Display of
Surfaces from Volume Data."

<p>

Scalar fields can be easily visualized using the VolVis ( Volume
Visualization ) module.  Great detail is revealed using this 3D
data rendering technique, which allows for representation of
four-dimensional data.

<h4> Module retrieval </h4>

There are two ways to bring up a VolVis module in SCIRun.

<p>

<LI> Scroll down to the bottom of the left hand listbox.  Double click
on the "VolVis" entry in the list.

<p>

<LI> In the top left listbox, scroll down to the bottom of the
list. Click the left mouse button in order to select the
"Visualization" entry.  In the top right list, scroll down to the
bottom of the list and double click on the VolVis entry.

<p>

Click on the UI button in order to bring up the user interface,
transfer map user interface and the volume viewing window.  The user
interface options are described in the "User Interface Options"
section of this document.

<h4> Attachments </h4>

The VolVis module must be connected to a

<A HREF="../../Readers/help/ScalarFieldReader.html">
Scalar Field Reader module </A>

or any other module which provides 3D scalar field data.  It may be
connected to the

<A HREF="GenColormap.html">
Colormap module </A>

or any module which provides a color map.  If a colormap is connected,
each of the scalar values is assigned a corresponding color which is
used in rendering the volume.  If no colormap is attached, the

<A HREF = "#TransferMap"> Transfer Map </A>

color map will be used.

<h4> User Interface Options </h4>

The main user interface consists of vertically arranged buttons.  The
top section of buttons with black labels corresponds to various volume
visualization options that may be modified by the user.  The bottom
section of buttons with blue labels corresponds to the "redraw" and
"execute" commands.

<p>

In order to access particular variables, select the desired button and
click the left mouse button.  The user interface corresponding to
that option will pop up on the screen.  If that user interface does
not pop up on the screen, bring it up from a minimized icon or look
for it somewhere on your screen.

<p>

In order to redraw the screen or force image recalculation,
select the "redraw" or "execute" button and click the
left mouse button.

<p>

The following are the options corresponding to each of the buttons:

<p>

<LI> <B>View</B> - Alter the eye position, at point position, up
vector, or the field of view.

<p>
<UL>

In order to set a value, place the mouse pointer on the corresponding
slider.  Push and hold the left mouse button, then drag the slider
until the desired value has been reached.  Release the mouse button.

</UL>

<LI> <B>Raster Size</B> - Alter the raster size which can range from 100-600
pixels in both the horizontal and vertical direction.

<p>
<UL>

In order to set a value, place the mouse pointer on the corresponding
slider.  Push and hold the left mouse button, then drag the slider
until the desired value has been reached.  Release the mouse button.

</UL>

<LI> <B>Background Color</B> - Specify the red, green, and blue
components of the background color ( Black is the default ).

<p>
<UL>

In order to set a value, place the mouse pointer on the corresponding
slider.  Push and hold the left mouse button, then drag the slider
until the desired value has been reached.  Release the mouse button.

</UL>

<A NAME = "TransferMap">

<LI> <B>Transfer Map</B> - Designate the opacity levels and color
values ( red, green, and blue color components ) corresponding to the
possible range of scalar values.

<p>
<UL>

<B> Range </B>

<p>

The opacity level and the color components range from 0 to 1.

<p>

<B> Line Correspondence </B>

<p>

Black line and nodes => scalar value - opacity.
<p>
Red line and nodes   => scalar value - red color component.
<p>
Green line and nodes => scalar value - green color component.
<p>
Blue line and nodes  => scalar value - blue color component.

<p>

<B> Nodes </B>

<p>

In this document, nodes are the colored circles visible on each line.
Nodes may be created, deleted, and moved.  Complex shaped lines may
thus be defined by the user.  As the mouse pointer is moved across the
graph area, the sliders on the sides follow its position.

<p>

<B> Node Movement </B>

<p>

To move a node, select it by moving the pointer on top of it ( the
node will fill with color ).  Click the left mouse button and while
holding it, drag the node to the desired position.  Horizontally, each
node can only move between its left and right neighbors.  Vertically,
the node can be moved to any location.

<p>

<B> Node Deletion </B>

<p>

To delete a node, select it by moving the pointer on top of it (
the node will fill with color ), and double click the right mouse
button.  The node will disappear, and the nodes to the left and right
of it will connect.  Note that the leftmost and the rightmost nodes (
the nodes at the min and max scalar values ) cannot be deleted.

<p>

<B> Node Addition </B>

<p>

To add a node, position the mouse cursor between the to-be-neighbors
of the new node.  For addition to:

<p>

<UL>
<LI> the Opacity line, double click the left mouse button.

<p>

<LI> the Red color component line, hold the shift keyboard
button and double click the left mouse button.

<p>

<LI> the Green color component line, hold the Ctrl
keyboard button and double click the left mouse button.

<p>

<LI> the Blue color component line, hold the Alt
keyboard button and double click the left mouse button.
</UL>

</UL>

<LI> <B>Redraw</B> - Force a redraw of the image.

<p>

<LI> <B>Execute</B> - Recalculate the image and redraw it.  The image
is recalculated based on the currently specified view, raster sizes,
background color, and the transfer map information.  Note that scalar
field change within the Scalar Field Reader forces the VolVis module
to execute.
