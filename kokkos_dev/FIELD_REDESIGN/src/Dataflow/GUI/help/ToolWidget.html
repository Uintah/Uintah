The Tool Widget consists of arbitrary geometry which is provided by
some external agent.  The primary use of the Tool Widget is in
surgical simulation, where simulated tools such as a scalpel, a laser,
and suction will be needed.<p>

The user moves the Tool Widget by dragging any of its graphical
components and setting an orientation.  The six degrees of freedom
will frequently be provided by a "flying mouse."<p>
