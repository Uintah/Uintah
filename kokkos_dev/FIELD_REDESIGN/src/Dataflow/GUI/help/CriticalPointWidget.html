<h3> CriticalPoint Widget Help </h3>

The CriticalPoint Widget consists of the Arrow Widget with additional
geometry representing the type of critical point (regular, attracting
node, repelling node, saddle, attracting focus, repelling focus, or
spiral saddle).  The primary use of the CriticalPoint Widget is to
investigate a vector field for critical points, where the geometry
will indicate the type of the closest critical point, and the arrow
will point toward that critical point.  Several instances of this
widget may be used in a non-interactive mode to simply mark critical
points with a geometric indicator.<p>

The user moves the CriticalPoint Widget by dragging any of its
graphical components.<p>

CriticalPoint Widget in seven modes from upper-left to lower-right:
attracting focus, regular, spiral saddle, attracting node, repelling
node, saddle, and repelling focus.<p>
