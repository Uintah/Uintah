MPEG Version 1.2

1) Printing documentation:

Documentation is in the PostScript file doc.ps. It is about 50 pages
long.

2) Making the program.

The makefile should be setup for most UNIX systems as is.  Simply type
"make" in the source code directory.

3) Testing the program.

A short test sequence is in short.mpg (and the coding is described in
short.trace).  If you wish to extract image sequence files from
short.mpg, type

mpeg -d -s short.mpg short

The resulting files should be in 

short0.Y, short0.U, short0.V
short1.Y, short1.U, short1.V
short2.Y, short2.U, short2.V
short3.Y, short3.U, short3.V
short4.Y, short4.U, short4.V
short5.Y, short5.U, short5.V
short6.Y, short6.U, short6.V

These files are raw raster-scan component files 352x240 for the Y,
176x120 for the U and V.

4) Displaying the decompressed files.

The decompressed *.Y *.U *.V files may be displayed through the
program "cv" which may be obtained by anonymous ftp from
havefun.stanford.edu:pub/cv/CVv1.1.tar.Z.  If the program is in your
current directory search-path, type

cv -a 0 -b 6 short

5) Recompressing the short sequence files.

To use the default settings, and to put the output in short2.mpg, type

mpeg -a 0 -b 6 short -s short2.mpg

See the documentation for more details on other parameters.


6) Some short interpreted programs for the encoder: (See Chapter 4 of
the documentation).
