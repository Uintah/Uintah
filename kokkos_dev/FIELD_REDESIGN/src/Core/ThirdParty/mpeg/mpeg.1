.SH DESCRIPTION
.I mpeg
is a multimedia image sequence compression/decompression
program that performs MPEG encoding and decoding.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -NTSC
indicates that the source frame size for the Luminance component is
352x240 and for the Chrominance components is 176x120. This is the
default size.
.TP
.B -CIF
indicates that the source frame size for the Luminance component is
352x288 and for the Chrominance components is 176x144.
.TP
.B -QCIF
indicates that the source frame size for the Luminance component is
176x144 and for the Chrominance components is 88x72.
.TP
.B -PF
indicates that the component sizes specified by 
.B -h
and
.B -v
are not multiples of 16 and furthermore that the input files (or output
files) should be exactly that specified by the component size
.B -h
and
.B -v
(or as read from the compressed stream).
Otherwise the input and output files will be the component size
rounded up to a multiple of 16 in each dimension.
.TP
.B -NPS
The NPS option allows the encoder to encode without having the
restriction that the last macroblock in a slice cannot be skipped.
For coding purposes, the first macroblock in a slice must be coded,
although the decoder will probably handle that case as well.
.TP
.B -MBPS
This specifies the macroblocks per slice.  If left unspecified then
the number of macroblocks per slice is the number of macroblocks on
one row of the image.
.TP
.B -UTC
Forces the frame number of the image to match
the Group-of-Pictures time code.  Only useful for the decoder.
.TP
.B -XING
enables XING compatible encoding for intra-frame only files
for the XING decoders.  May not be robust, but eventually XING
encoders and decoders will become more MPEG compatible. This specifies
160x120 encoding (apparently the defacto) for XING decoders.  If you
wish to overide the 160x120 encoding for XING image format, use the
.B -h
and 
.B -v
options after the
.B -XING
option.  By default
.B -PF
is always selected with 
-XING
option.
.TP
.B -DMVB
denotes Dynamic Motion Vector Bounding.
Should reduce the overall bits spent in the motion vectors if set.
Generally doesn't do that much for the default
settings, but changing the search limit will automatically enable the
dynamic motion vector bounding feature.
.TP
.B -MVNT
disables the motion vector telescoping.  Generally telescoping is
a big gain when the search window is small, though if the search
window grows large, telescoping may not be beneficial.
.TP
.B -a
denotes the following value to be the start of the filename index
[inclusive]. Defaults to 0.
.TP
.B -b
denotes the following value to be the end of the filename index
[inclusive]. Defaults to 0.
.TP
.B -d
enables the decoder.
The only options useful for the decoder are the filename
specifications and the
.B
-NPS, -UTC
commmands; the rest of the command-line
information is used for encoding.
.TP
.B -h
is the horizontal size of the picture in terms of the luminance component,
used for a non 
.B
-NTSC, -CIF, -QCIF
filesize.  See the preceding note about
.B -PF
about the dimensions of the file relative to that of the component.
.TP
.B -v
is the vertical size of the picture in terms of the luminance component,
used for a non 
.B
-NTSC, -CIF, -QCIF
filesize.  See the preceding note about
.B -PF
about the dimensions of the file relative to that of the component.
.TP
.B -f
is the number of interpolated frames between each intra/predicted
frame.
.B FrameInterval-1
is the number of interpolated frames within each frame interval.
.TP
.B -g
is the number of frame intervals per group-of-pictures.  With a group
interval of 1 then there are no predicted frames.  The value
.B GroupInterval-1
is the number of predicted frames in each group of pictures.
.TP
.B -4
is used to DC Intraframe mode where only the DC components of each picture
block is coded.
.TP
.B -i
is the diameter of the motion estimation search. The diameter must be
be positive.  The default value is 15 for a search window of approx
(+- 7.5, +- 7.5).   The motion estimation is telescopic for frame
distances greater than 1 (thus having
a greater effective range).  The telescopic motion estimation can be turned
off by the
.B -MVNT
flag.  This option can now have a value greater than 15
but less than approximately 960.  For large values the estimation becomes
very slow.
.TP
.B -o
signals that the program interpreter will read the control algorithms
from the standard input.
.TP
.B -p
specifies the picture rate by a code directly placed into the stream.
It must be a number between 0 and 8. (default 5=30Hz).
.TP
.B -q
gives a value for the quantization not in the presence of rate
control (rate control automatically changes the quantization values).
If rate control is specified, this parameter gives a value for the
initial quantization of the first frame (which the program usually
takes an educated guess at).
.TP
.B -r
specified a rate for the coded stream. If this is enabled, a buffer
model is used to limit the size of the coding stream. Note this is
given in bits per second.
.TP
.B -s
specifies the filename to store the coded image. If unspecified it
defaults to
.B ComponentFilePrefix0.mpg.
.TP
.B -v
designates that quantization decisions are to be written to standard
output. This is the verbose mode.
.TP
.B -x
gives a target filesize for the compressed stream. This overrides the
rate option
.B -r,
if specified. This is specified in bits.  The
actual implementation of this technique is through calculating the
equivalent bit-rate. Since the buffer usually has some contents at the
end of coding, the final filesize is larger than actually designated.
.TP
.B -y
enables the double-precision floating point Reference DCT. The default
is the Chen DCT.
.TP
.B -z
denotes the component file suffixes in sequential order. For example
.B
 -z .y.clr -z .u.clr -z .v.clr
indicates that the luminance and the two chrominance files
end with a suffix of
.B
\&.y.clr, \&.u.clr,
and
.B \&.v.clr,
in that order. If unspecified, the suffixes
default to
.B
\&.Y, \*.U,\fR
and
.B \&.V.
.TP
.B ComponentFilePrefix\fIn\fR
must be specified. In general, the other component files share the
same prefix and will default to
.B ComponentFilePrefix1
if not
explicitly specified. However, in some cases the prefix is what
changes in the file and we can specify this individually.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
To encode a set of raw raster scan YCbCr (also known as digital YUV) files with
dimension 352x240 Y, 176x120 U,V,
with labels,
.B
hello0.Y hello0.U hello0.V,
.B
hello1.Y hello1.U hello1.V,
.B
\&...,
.B
hello12.Y hello12.U hello12.V
through the mpeg encoder, type

.br
.B
mpeg -a 0 -b 12 hello -s hello.mpg
.br

This creates the output file 
.B hello.mpg.
In order to decode such a file into a sequence of image files with
prefix
.B goodbye,
type

.br
.B
mpeg -d -s hello.mpg goodbye
.br

The output will be placed in the files
.B
goodbye0.Y goodbye0.U goodbye0.V,
.B
goodbye1.Y goodbye1.U goodbye1.V,
.B
\&...,
.B
goodbye12.Y goodbye12.U goodbye12.V.
These image sequences can be displayed by the
.I cv
program.
The image sequences can also be converted to ppm and back through
the programs
.I cyuv2ppm
and 
.I ppm2cyuv
Those utility programs available by anonymous ftp from
.I havefun.stanford.edu:pub/cv/CVv1.2.1.tar.Z.
There are more options within an internal program interpreter.
Please see the accompanying documentation in
.I doc.ps
