    <p>Find connected components (CCs). This works on 1-byte and 2-byte
integral values, as well as 4-byte ints.</p>
    <p>Type: type to use for output, to store the CC ID values. If Use smallest for output type is checked, the type used will be the smallest of uchar, ushort, or int, that can represent all the CC ID values. Using this option allows one to specify the integral type to be used.</p>
    <p>Connectivity : indicates what kind of connectivity to use, or
     the number of coordinates that vary in order to traverse the
     neighborhood of a given sample. In 2D: 1: 4-connected,
     2: 8-connected. This value should be represented by an integer.</p>
