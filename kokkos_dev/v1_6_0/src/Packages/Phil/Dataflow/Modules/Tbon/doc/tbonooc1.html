<h1>TBONOOC1</h1>

<b>Description:</b><p>

<a href="template.html">Template class</a> (Please read!)<p>

Implementation of an out-of-core algorithm based on the Temporal
Branch-on-Need Octree (T-BON) for rectilinear scalar fields.<p>

Some preprocessing must be done before isosurface extraction.
This preprocessing is DIFFERENT from that of the 
<a href="tbon.html">TBON</a> and
<a href="tbonooc2.html">TBONOOC2</a> modules - don't just use the files
resulting from those preprocess.  Your results will be incorrect.
<p>

During execution (run the module on an execution metafile), the
user controls isovalue and time value sliders.  Nodes and data are read
in whenever needed to construct the current isosurface, otherwise
left on disk.  Nodes and data are read in in blocks to improve I/O
performance (again, see the thesis).  Dynamic data structures are
used to hold both node and data blocks (see algorithm 1 in the thesis).
A Marching Cubes-type 
interpolation is performed to create triangles for rendering.<p>

The maximum sizes for the dynamic data structures are declared
statically in TbonOOC1.cc:<p>

<pre>
static const int NODEBRICKS = &lt size of node list &gt;
static const int DATABRICKS = &lt size of data list &gt;
</pre>
<p>

The <b>minimum</b> settings for these values are:<br>

<pre>
static const int NODEBRICKS = 1;
static const int DATABRICKS = 8;
</pre>

These are the minimum settings!  I don't recommend setting DATABRICKS
to anything higher, anyway.<p>


<p><b>Metafile format:</b><p>

Although the results of preprocessing are not the same, the metafile
format for TBONOOC1 is the same as that of the <a href="tbon.html">
TBON</a> module.<p>
