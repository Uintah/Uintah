        A GUI Point widget is created and can be moved around in the
        scene.  The Probe Point port contains a PointCloudField field with
        one point in it at the location of the probe.  The value at
        that point is interpolated from the input field.  The input
        field is also used to determine the initial position and
        relative size of the probe widget.
      </p>
      <p>
	The Element Index matrix contains the Index of the item with
        data that is nearest the cell.  A possible use would be to
        feed the index into MatrixSelectVector to get out a time-dependent
        sequence associated with that element.
