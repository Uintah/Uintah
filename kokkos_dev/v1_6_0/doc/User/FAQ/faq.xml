such as: </para> 
  </description> 

  <entry> <keywords>unable to load module, can't find
 symbol</keywords>
    <question> 
      <para> When I run SCIRun, one or more 
messages appear in the message window indicating a problem with a package and/or 
module.</para>
      <para> The message(s) is/are 
similar to the following: 
      </para> 
      <pre>Loading package 'SCIRun'
Unable to load module 'CastField' :
- can't find symbol 'make_CastField'
      </pre>
      <para>
        or
      </para>
      <pre>Unable to load all of package 'Teem' (category 'DataIO' failed) :
- libPackages_Teem_Dataflow.so: cannot open shared object file: No
such file or directory
- libPackages_Teem_Dataflow_Modules_DataIO.so: cannot open shared
object file: No such file or directory
      </pre>
    </question> 
    <answer> 
      <para> Each module for a given package has its own .xml file 
that describes it. When SCIRun starts, it parses all the .xml files in the packages 
(under Dataflow/XML) and tries to find the matching code within the related .so 
files. If the .so files cannot be found the message "No such file or directory" 
is given. If the .so can be found, but the code for a particular module does not 
exist within the library, then the message "can't find symbol" is
    given. 
      </para> 
      <para> The message(s) may or may not indicate a problem with SCIRun. For some 
modules, the .xml file may be listed but the code has not yet been completed (this 
may be common for module developers). For others it may mean that the SCIRun installation 
is some how corrupt (.so files have been deleted, moved, etc.) 
      </para> 
      <para> 
The solution to this problem is to either a) build the libraries that the .xml 
files need, or b) remove the offending .xml files.

    <question>
      <para>
          What is the relationship between SCIRun, BioPSE, and the other
          SCI Institute software?
      </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <para>
      It is important to understand the place of the software included in
      this package within the hierarchy of computational problem solving
      environments developed at the SCI Institute.  From a historical
      perspective, <I>SCIRun</I>, which we started developing in 1992, was
      the original implementation of the computational framework.  Since
      then, <I>SCIRun</I> and its computational workbench infrastructure
      have been the origin of many significant application-specific
      projects.  Two major examples are the DOE sponsored Uintah system and
      the NIH sponsored <I>BioPSE</I> system (from the (<A NAME="tex2html3"
      HREF="http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/">National Center for Research
      Resources</A> (NCRR) Center at <A NAME="tex2html4"
      HREF="http://www.sci.utah.edu/ncrr/">Utah</A>).  The target
      applications of the Uintah project are combustion, computational
      fluid dynamics, and mechanical modeling implemented on large-scale,
      distributed, shared memory architectures.  The goal of the
      <I>BioPSE</I> project is to create software for geometric modeling,
      simulation, and visualization for solving bioelectric field problems.
      An important secondary goal of the <I>SCIRun</I> system is to make
      source code for these problem solving environments publicly available
      to the scientific community.</para>
 
      <para> To realize these two significant projects, the <I>SCIRun</I>
      infrastructure itself has required significant reorganization,
      extension, and enhancement.  Even with these recent changes,
      <I>SCIRun</I> remains both the core infrastructure for our problem
      solving environments and the name we use to refer to the entire
      ensemble of software.  Thus a user may install and operate the core
      <I>SCIRun</I> software and also augment its functionality with one or
      more of the ``packages'' such as <I>BioPSE</I>.  We anticipate that
      the collection of packages will grow as the advantages of the
      <I>SCIRun</I> infrastructure become available to scientists and
      engineers of all disciplines.</para>

</para> <para> In addition to the major projects that have both leveraged and 
advanced <I>SCIRun</I>, there exist a number of smaller packages that can extend 
<I>SCIRun</I>'s utility. Examples include the <I>Teem</I> package for raster data 
processing, the <I>NetSolve</I> package for linear algebra subroutines (developed 
by researchers at the University of Tennessee and Knoxville), and a communications 
interface we have recently introduced to the <I>Matlab</I> program. We have developed 
various forms of software wrappers or interfaces that allow <I>SCIRun</I> to leverage 
the strengths of these third party tools, links we refer to as "bridges."</para> 
<para> There are also instances in which a tighter level of integration than a 
bridge between <I>SCIRun</I> and third-party software is necessary. One example 
is the addition of mpeg support for capturing animations from the <I>SCIRun</I> 
Viewer module, for which we use the Berkeley and Alex Knowles' mpeg encoding tools. 
Another example is the set of image generation and manipulation tools from Paul 
Haeberli called <I>libimage</I>. To indicate whether or not such tools are available, 
the configure scripts for <I>SCIRun</I> contain optional control flags.</para> 
<para> We believe that this combination of a robust infrastructure and modular 
extensibility through packages and third-party libraries will allow <I>SCIRun</I> 
to grow and adapt to changing needs and opportunities.</para> </answer> </entry> 
<entry> <keywords>file conversion, import and export</keywords> <question> <para> 
How do I get my data into <I>SCIRun</I>? </para> </question> <answer> <para> Like 
all program, <I>SCIRun</I> has its own data file formats so conversion is required. 
At present, the pathway for converting data files is to use one of a set of stand-alone 
converter programs that are part of the regular <I>SCIRun</I> distribution. Here 
is the list of available converters: </para> <para> <strong>RawToTriSurf: </strong> 
converts simple ASCII files containing node locations, triangle connectivity, 
and optionally scalar data into <I>SCIRun</I> a field data file.</para> <para> 
Usage: RawToTriSurf pts-file tris-file [vals-file] fieldout.fld </para> <para> 
where: </para> <para> <strong><tt>pts-file</tt> </strong> is a file containing 
point locations for the geometry, a single triplet of x, y, z in each line of 
the file. </para> <para> <strong><tt>tris-file</tt> </strong> is a file containing 
connectivity for the triangles, with each row of the file pointing to three node 
numbers in the <tt>pts-file</tt>. The node numbering starts at 0 in these files. 
</para> <para> <strong><tt>vals-file</tt> </strong> is an optional file that contains 
scalar values to be associated with the nodes of the geometry. These files have 
the same number of values as the <tt>pts-file</tt> with one value per line of 
the file. </para> <para> <strong><tt>fieldout.fld</tt> </strong> is the output 
fields file containing the geometry and associated scalar data. </para> <para> 
The Cardiovascular Research and Training Institute (CVRTI) has developed a number 
of scalar and vector data and geometry file formats which required converters 
for <em>SCIRun</em>. The result is a set of stand-alone programs that read in 
one more more existing CVRTI files and generate a particular form of <em>SCIRun</em> 
file, the details of which depend on the particular combination of nodes, connectivities, 
and associated attributes.</para> <para> The programs and their parameters as

    <question>
      <para>
	By default, what directions the positive x,y,z axis point to in the
	viewer module?
      </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <para>
	By default you're looking down the negative-z axis, positive-x
	point to your right, and positive-y points up.  If you have the
	Axes turned on, you'll see arrows pointing in +/-{x,y,z}.  The way
	to remember which is which is: (R,G,B) = (X,Y,Z).  And the arrows
	pointing in the positive directions are brighter than the ones
	pointing in the negative directions.  One last note, you can click
	on the "Views" button at the botton-right of the ViewWindow, and
	snap to a "canonical" view whenever you'd like (e.g. "Look down +Z
	axis, Up vector +Y").

Currently you must scale everything else down to the size of unit-axes,
by using the Math::BuildTransform and Field::TransformField modules.
