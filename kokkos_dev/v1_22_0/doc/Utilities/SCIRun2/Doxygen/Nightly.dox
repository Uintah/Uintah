\page nightly Nightly build results from the CVS code repository

The CVS version of the SCIRun2 software is built each night and the results are
compiled in the log files referenced below.  These logs will give you an idea
of the state of the code on any given day.  It is a good idea to check these
logs before attempting to build SCIRun2 from a new CVS checkout.
