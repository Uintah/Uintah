	  I upgraded my Mac to OSX 10.3.6 and SCIRun broke.  How do I fix this?

      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>
	  The 10.3.6 Mac OSX upgrade caused the GL state to use more
          memory.  This caused the &sr; rendering thread to run out of
          stack memory.  This has been fixed in &sr; version 1.24.  If
          you wish to continue using 1.22, you can resolve this
          problem by following these steps:

      <question>
	<para>
	  What is the relationship between &sr;, BioPSE, and other SCI
	  Institute software?
	</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>
	  It is important to understand the hierarchy of computational problem solving
	  environments developed at the SCI Institute.  From a historical
	  perspective, &sr;, which started development in 1992, was the
	  original implementation of the computational framework.  Since then,
	  &sr; and its computational workbench infrastructure has been the
	  origin of many significant application-specific projects. Two major
	  examples are the DOE sponsored Uintah system and the NIH sponsored
	  BioPSE system (from the <ulink url="http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/">National
	  Center for Research Resources</ulink> (NCRR) Center at <ulink
	  url="http://www.sci.utah.edu/ncrr/">Utah</ulink>). The target
	  applications of the Uintah project are combustion, computational fluid
	  dynamics, and mechanical modeling implemented on large-scale,
	  distributed, shared memory architectures. The goal of the BioPSE
	  project is to create software for geometric modeling, simulation, and
	  visualization for solving bioelectric field problems.  A
	  secondary goal of the &sr; system is to make source code for 
	  problem solving environments publicly available to the scientific
	  community.
	</para>
	<para>
	  To realize these significant projects, the &sr; infrastructure
	  has required significant reorganization, extension, and
	  enhancement.  Even with these changes, &sr; remains the
	  core infrastructure for problem solving environments, and the name
	  used to refer to the entire ensemble of software.  Thus, a user may
	  install and operate the core &sr; software and also augment its
	  functionality with one or more of the <quote>packages</quote> such as
	  BioPSE.  SCI anticipates that the collection of packages will grow as
	  the advantages of the &sr; infrastructure become available to
	  scientists and engineers of all disciplines.

	</para>

	<para>
	  In addition to major projects that have both leveraged and
	  advanced &sr;, there exist a number of smaller packages that 
	  extend &sr;'s utility. Examples include the Teem package for raster
	  data processing, the NetSolve package for linear algebra subroutines
	  (developed by researchers at the University of Tennessee and
	  Knoxville), and a communications interface recently introduced
	  to the Matlab program. SCI has developed various forms of software
	  wrappers or interfaces that allow &sr; to leverage the strengths of
	third party tools, links referred to as "bridges."  </para>
	<para>
	  There are instances when a tighter level of integration than
	  a bridge between &sr; and third-party software is necessary. One
	  example is the addition of mpeg support for capturing animations from
	  the &sr; Viewer module. SCI uses the Berkeley and Alex
	  Knowles' mpeg encoding tools.  Another example is the set of image
	  generation and manipulation tools from Paul Haeberli called
	  libimage. To indicate if such tools are available, the
	  configure scripts for &sr; contain optional control flags.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The combination of a robust infrastructure and
	  modular extensibility through packages and third-party libraries 
	  allows &sr; to grow and adapt to changing needs and opportunities.

      <question>
	<para>The same descriptions are given for the
	ApplyFEMCurrentSource module and the ApplyFEMVoltageSource
	module. To which module does the description apply?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
	<para>The difference between these modules is that the
	ApplyFEMCurrrentSource module is used to apply Neumann boundary
	conditions; known values related to the first spatial derivative
	of the potential, (e.g. flux, current density, dipoles). </para>
	<para>The ApplyFEMVoltageSource module is used to apply Dirichlet
	boundary conditions; known values for the potential at specific
	locations. In both cases, boundary conditions affect the right
	side of the linear system, which is why both modules take an
	optional RHS ColumnMatrix as input, and produce a modified RHS
	ColumnMatrix as output. In the case of a Dirichlet BC, the
	stiffness matrix must also be modified, which is why
	ApplyFEMVoltageSource requires the stiffness matrix as input, and
	produces a modified stiffness matrix as output.</para>
	<para>Typically, ApplyFEMCurrentSource takes two Fields as input:
	a TetVolField that specifies the geometry and conductivity
	information for the volume (e.g. brain-eg-mesh.tvt.fld), and a
	collection of dipole sources (PointCloudField&lt;Vector&gt;).</para>
	<para>In contrast, the ApplyFEMVoltageSource applies Dirichlet
	condition at location in the mesh where potentials are
	known. Unlike the ApplyFEMCurrentSource, the
	ApplyFEMVoltageSource requires a second upstream
	module. Specifically, an InsertVoltageSource module is
	required. The user passes the TetvolField of conductivity
	(e.g. brain-eg-mesh.tvt.fld) into the first Field input port
	of InsertVoltageSource, and a PointCloudField&lt;double>
	specifying the positions and voltages of the known potentials
	into the second Field input port. The module identifies which
	nodes of the mesh the Dirichlet conditions will be applied,
	and stores that information with the output TetvolField. The
	output TetVolField, which now has the Dirichlet BC information
	stored as a Property of the field, is passed into the first
	input port of ApplyFEMVoltageSource.

	</screen>
      </question>
      <answer>
	<para>One feature of SCIRun/BioPSE is that it dynamically
	compiles some parts of the code at run-time based on the data
	passed through the network.  If installed from an RPM (and
	unless instructed otherwise) SCIRun will try to generate code
	in
	<filename>/usr/local/SCIRun/linux/on-the-fly-libs/</filename>.
	SCIRun won't (usually) have privilages to write to this
	directory.  The issue is fixed by creating a directory in your
	home directory, and setting the
	<envar>SCIRUN_ON_THE_FLY_LIBS</envar> environment variable to
	point to the new directory.  For example:
	<literallayout class="monospaced">
  mkdir /home/dmw/on-the-fly-libs/
  setenv SCIRUN_ON_THE_FLY_LIBS /home/dmw/on-the-fly-libs/
	</literallayout>
	SCIRun must be restarted to effect these changes.

      </question>
      <answer>
	<para>No, not in general.  But, in the BioPSE package there is a
	module called ShowLeads that takes a matrix as input, and
	renders a 2d graph. The module assumes that rows are a time
	series of data, with columns the timestep values.</para>

      <answer>
	<para>
	  One of the features of SCIRun/BioPSE is that it dynamically compiles
	  some parts of the code at run-time based on the data that you're
	  passing through your network.  In order for this to work, the software
	  needs to be able to dynamically create files.  However, because you
	  have installed the software from RPM, the directory that the dynamic
	  files are wrtten to by default, <filename>/usr/local/SCIRun/linux/on-the-fly-libs/</filename>, is owned by root&#x2014;which
	  is why the program is having problems.  You can  fix this by
	  creating a different directory that you own, and setting your
	  <envar>SCIRUN_ON_THE_FLY_LIBS</envar> environment variable to point at that new
	  directory.  This environment variable overrides the default location,
	  so that should fix the problem you're having.  For example:
	  <literallayout class="monospaced">
	    mkdir /home/dmw/on-the-fly-libs/
	    setenv SCIRUN_ON_THE_FLY_LIBS /home/dmw/on-the-fly-libs/

	<para>There are problems with the 4191 Nvidia drivers, causing

	  Since 4191 is the most recent driver on nvidia's

      <question>
	<para>
	  How are inverse problems in electrocardiography solved in
	  SCIRUN/BIOPSE. The so-called transfer matrix T is built and
	  then a least-squares problem is solved. The transfer matrix
	  is expressed using inverses of submatrices. Is this matrix T
	  effectively computed? Are inverses really computed ?  What
	  is the method implemented? In which modules can the source
	  code be seen?
	</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>
	  There are two general solutions to the bioelectric inverse
	  problem.  One formulation tries to recover equivalent dipole
	  sources. The other tries to recover the voltages on an
	  interior surface that is assumed to encompass any source
	  (i.e. there are no sources located between the measurement
	  surface and the interior surface).
	</para>
	<para>
	  In the first formulation (surface-to-source inversion), the
	  inverse problem can be over-constrained (searching for a
	  single dipole that accounts for the outer surface
	  measurements), or under-constrained (searching for a large
	  number of dipoles that are distributed through the domain).
	  The over-constrained case is called parameterized inversion,
	  The under-constrained case is called non-parameterized.  In
	  the parameterized case, a search algorithm locates the
	  dipole that best reproduces the measured data. In the
	  non-parameterized case, find the minimum-norm solution that
	  best fits some a-priori information about the data (e.g. the
	  solution should be spatially focused).
	</para>
	<para>
	  The inverse problem is ill-conditioned because of the
	  poorly-specified boundary conditions on the inner surface.
	  The formulation uses the transfer matrix built from a
	  combination of sub-matrices from the stiffness matrix.
	  SCIRun solves the resulting linear systems, but not by
	  computing an explicit inverse. Rather, an iterative
	  (conjugate-gradient) algorithm is used. There is a
	  preliminary version of this code, unfortunately, it has not
	  yet been released in BioPSE.  For the moment, see <ulink
	  url="http://www.sci.utah.edu/publications/spie95.ps.Z">this
	  SPIE `95 paper</ulink>, which describes this technique in
	  more detail.  This algorithm will be part of BioPSE in early
	  Spring.

	  When running &sr;, one or more messages appear in the
	  message window indicating a problem with a package and/or
	  module.  The message(s) is/are similar to the following:
	  <literallayout class="monospaced">
	    Loading package '&sr;' Unable to load module 'CastField' :
	    - can't find symbol 'make_CastField'

	  </literallayout>
	</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>
	  Each module for a given package has its own .xml file that
	  describes it. When &sr; starts, it parses all .xml files in
	  the packages (under Dataflow/XML) and tries to find the
	  matching code within the related .so files. If the .so files
	  cannot be found, the message <quote>No such file or
	  directory</quote>" is given. If the .so can be found, but
	  the code for a particular module does not exist within the
	  library, the message <quote>can't find symbol</quote> is
	  given.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The message(s) may or may not indicate a problem with &sr;. For some
	  modules, the .xml file may be listed, but the code has not been
	  completed (this may be common for module developers). For other modules,
	  the &sr; installation is some how corrupt (.so files
	  have been deleted, moved, etc.)
	</para> 
	<para>
	  The solution is to build  libraries 
	  the .xml files need or remove the offending .xml files.

      <answer>
	<para>
	  The most likely reason for seeing this is that you have
	  found a bug in SCIRun with the locking of the X display.
	  You should report this problem to
	  scirun-develop@sci.utah.edu.  The last time this error
	  occurred it was in
	  <filename>Dataflow/Modules/Render/OpenGL.cc</filename> and
	  required that a glGetIntegerv() call be placed within a
	  gui->lock()/unlock() section.
