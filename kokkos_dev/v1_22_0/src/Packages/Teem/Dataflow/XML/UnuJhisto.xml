    <summary>Create joint histogram of two or more nrrds. Each axis of the
output corresponds to one of the input nrrds, and each bin in the output

    <p>Create joint histogram of two or more nrrds. Each axis of the
output corresponds to one of the input nrrds, and each bin in the output
records the number of corresponding positions in the inputs with a combination
of values represented by the coordinates of the bin.</p>
    <p> Bins : bins(i) is the number of bins to use along axis i (of
    joint histogram), which represents the values of InputNrrd(i). This
    should be two or more integers separated by white space.</p>
    <p>Mins : min(i) is the low range of values to be quantized
    along axis i; use nan to represent lowest value
    present. This should be two more more double separated by white space 
    (except when using nan).</p>
    <p>Maxs : max(i) is the high range of values to be quantized
    along axis i; use nan to represent highest value present. This should
    be two or more double separated by white space (except when using nan).</p>
    <p>Type : nrrd type to use for output (the type used to store hit counts in the join histogram). Clamping is done on hit counts so that they never overflow a fixed-point type.</p>
   <p>WeightNrrd : An optional input indicating how to weigh contributions to joint histogram. If this port is not connected, the increment is one bin count per sample, but by giving a nrrd, the value in the nrrd at the corresponding location will be the bin count increment.</p>
