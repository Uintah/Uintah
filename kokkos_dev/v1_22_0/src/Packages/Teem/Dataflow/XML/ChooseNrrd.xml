      <p>
        ChooseNrrd takes in an arbitrary number of input Nrrds, and
        pass one of them downstream, based on the port index typed in the UI. If the Use first valid nrrd option is checked, the module will disregard the port index and iterate over the input ports, passing the first valid data downstream.
