      <p>ComputeCurrent calculate the current density vector
field.  Required inputs are the electric field and mesh with
conductivities.

Technical note: The current density vector field J is the product of sigma and -del V.
The minus sign is added in ComputeCurrent, so the electric field input should be
positive (which is the unmodified output of the <modref package="SCIRun" name="Gradient"/> module).</p>
