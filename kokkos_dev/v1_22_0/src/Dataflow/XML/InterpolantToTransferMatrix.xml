        Convert an interpolant field into an equivalent transfer
        matrix.  The transfer matrix will be of type SparseRowMatrix.  The
        matrix rows correspond to the source field indices and the columns
        refer to the destination field indices.

<title>InterpolantToTransferMatrix Regression Test</title>

<p>Extract an interpolant field from an input field onto a sample lattice
for example purposes.  Then that interpolant is applied to the input
field using two different techniques:  First it is applied with the
ApplyInterpolant module.  Second it is converted into a matrix using
the InterpolantToTransferMatrix module, and then that matrix is
multiplied with the data from the original field to compute the
interpolation.  The results of both methods are then compared using
the ErrorMetric module to verify that they are equivalent.</p>
