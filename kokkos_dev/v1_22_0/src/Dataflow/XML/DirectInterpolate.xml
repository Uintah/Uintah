    <summary>The DirectInterpolate module takes two Fields as input, the first of which, Source, contains geometry and data values; the second, Destination, contains geometry only. DirectInterpolate takes a field and finds data values for the destination geometry and outputs the resulting Field.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        DirectInterpolate will find the corresponding data value in the Source for each node in the Destination Field. The data values can be stored at the nodes, cells, edges, or faces of the mesh at either the input or output ports.  If the geometires of the input ports are different, the module will calculate data values for the Destination by interpolation.
      </p>
<p> The DirectInterpolate GUI contains a check box for Enable Interpolation and Use Closest Element If Not Interpable.  The Enable Interpolation check box allows the user to select the option of interpolation.  The user can also select the option of choosing the closest element when a data value cannot be interpolated.  The Maximum Closeness option indicates the maximum distance between points of interpolation and data values.</p>

<p>SamplePlane is used to place a cutting plane through the utah torso
model, and then the voltage values from the torso field are
interpolated onto this cutting plane.  The field boundary is also
displayed for reference.</p>
