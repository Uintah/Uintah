      Apply an interpolant field to project the data from one
      field onto the mesh of another field.
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        This module interpolates the "Source" field onto the geometry of
        the Interpolant field.  The Interpolant field would be
        preconstructed using the <modref package="SCIRun" name="BuildInterpolant"/> module.
      </p>
      <p>
        The source field for <modref package="SCIRun" name="BuildInterpolant"/> and ApplyInterpolant
        must contain the same geometry and data locations.  However
        they do not have to contain the same data values or value
        types.  For instance, a TetVolField of doubles with data at the
        nodes can be passed into the Source port of <modref package="SCIRun" name="BuildInterpolant"/>,
        and a TetVolField of Vectors with data also at the nodes and with
        the same mesh can be passed into the source port of
        ApplyInterpolant.
      </p>
      <p>
        <modref package="SCIRun" name="DirectInterpolate"/> should be used instead of <modref package="SCIRun" name="BuildInterpolant"/>
        and ApplyInterpolant if the Interpolant is not to be reused,
        as it does the same interpolation without building the
        intermediate interpolant field.  This should be used if the
        source field changes much more often than the destination field.

<title>ApplyInterpolant Regression Test</title>

<p>Build an interpolant from an input field onto a plane, and then use
ApplyInterpolant to apply the data from the input field back to the
interpolant field.</p>

<p>Note that the same thing could be done by replacing both
<modref package="SCIRun" name="BuildInterpolant"/> and ApplyInterpolant with a <modref package="SCIRun" name="DirectInterpolate"/> module.
ApplyInterpolate was meant primarily to be used in conjunction with
loops and time dependent data, such that the interpolant field could
be computed once and then applied multiple times.</p>

<p>See also <modref package="SCIRun" name="BuildInterpolant"/>, <modref package="SCIRun" name="DirectInterpolate"/>, <modref package="SCIRun" name="ApplyInterpMatrix"/>.</p>
