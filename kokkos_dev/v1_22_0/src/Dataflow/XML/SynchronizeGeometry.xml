    <summary>Create a barrier to synchronize a set of geometry streams.</summary>
    <description>
	<p> A geometry stream is composed of multiple geometry samples.
	    Each geometry sample is created by calling GeometryOPort::
	    delObj() and/or GeometryOPort::addObj() one or more times.
	    All geometry samples with the same virtual sequence number
	    in differenct streams must reach the barrier before they can
	    all proceed. The boundary of geometry samples is the 
	    GeometryFlush or GeometryFlushViews message, which is sent 
	    out explicitly by calling functions like GeometryOPort::
	    flushViews(), or implicitly by SCIRun after you did some 
	    geometry operations (delete or add) in Module::execute() but 
	    did not call any flush messages. With a checkbox in the control
	    panel, users can dynamically choose whether or not to enforce 
	    the barrier.
