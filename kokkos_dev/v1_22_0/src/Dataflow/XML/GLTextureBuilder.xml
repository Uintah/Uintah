    <summary>This module builds an octree based texture with leaves
    that are a power of cubed that is designed to be used for OpenGL
    volume rendering.
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p>The brick size option allows testing and or the use of older
      graphics hardware. The maximum brick size allowed by the
      hardware should be used.
      </p>
      <p> Select auto scale or fixed scale for mapping
      the colors in the transfer function to the data. The auto scale
      option gathers the minimum and maximum data values, then maps
      the colors in the transfer functions linearly to this range.
      The fixed scale option allows the user to enter the minimum and
      maximum values for the linear mapping.  
      </p>
      <p> Currently, only the <modref package="SCIRun" name="TextureVolVis"/> and the <modref package="SCIRun" name="TexCuttingPlanes"/>
      modules use the texture produced by this module.
