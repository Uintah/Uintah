      <p> Make an ImageField that fits the source field.  The value
type of the ImageField is similar to that of the input field.  If
there is no input field specified, then create a unit area of
doubles.  The size parameters refer to the number of nodes in the
volume, not the number of faces.  Thus a 2x2x2 node image will only
contain one facet. </p>

      <p> The Pad Percentage parameter is an optional parameter that
describes how much larger than the input field the resulting image
area should be.  For example, a value of 100 would make the image field
be three times as far across and contain nine times the
area of an image with the default 0 padding.  A value of 50 would
cause the image to be twice as far across (50% bigger on each side).
</p>

      <p> No interpolation is done onto the new field.  It is
recommended that the <modref package="SCIRun" name="DirectInterpolate"/> module be used if those values
are needed. </p>
