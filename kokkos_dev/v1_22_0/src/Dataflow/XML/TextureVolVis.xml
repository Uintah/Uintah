    <summary>This module implements a volume renderer using 3D texture
    hardware.

      <p>
        The Rendering Style Frame allows the selection of standard
        (Over Operator), maximum intensity projection (MIP) or
        attenuated (Attenuate) rendering styles.
     </p>
      <p> For large data, the View Mode, allows the user view the data
        at full resolution, or to see the maximum resolution along a
        line of sight or in a region of influence.  The line of sight
        and region of influence modes are controlled by a selection
        widget in the view window.
     </p>
      <p> The Interpolation Mode specifies linear interpolation
      (Interpolate) or nearest neighbor interpolation (Nearest).
        
     </p>
      <p> The slice transparency slider allows the user to control the
      slice transparency in concert with the transparency specified in the
      transfer function that was  provided to the <modref package="SCIRun" name="GLTextureBuilder"/>.  The range
      is from -1 (full transparency for each slice) to 0 (accept
      the values in the transfer function) to 1 (full opacity for each
      slice--except for regions that are zero in the transfer function)
     </p>
      <p> The number of slices slider controls rendering
      quality. Increase the number of slices to improve rendering
      quality. Decrease the number of slice to improve interaction.
