      <p>
        ChangeFieldBounds is used to transform the field geometry.
      </p>

    <description>
      <p>
        ChangeFieldBounds can trasform the field geometry via the UI or 
	a widget attached to a <modref package="SCIRun" name="Viewer"/> window.
      </p>
      <p>
	The output field is the transformed input field.
      </p>
      <p>
	The output matrix is the resultant transformation matrix used
	to transform the field.  It can be used to transform other
	fields in SCIRun.
      </p>
      <p>
	The UI can change the center and the size of the output
	field.  Check the box next to the output attribute you wish to modify.
	The 'Copy Input to Output' button will reset the
	output values to the input values.
      </p>
      <p>
	To interactively transform the input field you must attach the
	Widget Port (the middle output port) to the viewer window.
      </p>
      <p>	
	To move the widget: Shift+RightClick on the edges of the widget
	frame and move the transformation box around.
      </p>
      <p>
	To scale the widget:  Shift+RightClick on the spheres located on
	each face of the widget and drag.  This will scale the output
	field in a direction normal to the face the sphere is located
	on.

          The 6 entries describe two 3D points, which are the min and
          max points of the axis aligned bounding box of the field.

<title>ChangeFieldBounds Regression Test</title>

<p>Input a field, and then use the widget from ChangeFieldBounds to
transform the field to a new position.  Both the original and
transformed fields are displayed, with the original being a wireframe
and the transformed field being solid.  In addition to simply moving
the input field we also do an asymetric scale on it such that it
becomes flattened.</p>
