/*
 *  SystemCallManager.h
 *
 *  The classes in this file represent the low level interface to calling unix 
 *  programs outside of SCIRun. The idea of this class is to have a separate
 *  SCIRun process from which we can fork external processes. The advantage of
 *  having a separate process over a separate thread is that we have full 
 *  control over the STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR of a process. In other words we can
 *  fully wrap SCIRun around an external program and use a SCIRun module to
 *  give an external program an interface. This class is mainly meant to wrap
 *  the STDIO handling and error handling and hide the existance of a separate
 *  thread from the developer by wrapping it in a class.
 *  The SystemCallManager class also keeps track of which processes have been 
 *  launched, so they can adequately be killed once SCIRun exits. Especially
 *  with separate processes it is important to keep track of what is out there
 *  For internal communication a combination of fifos and pipes is used. These
 *  are obviously all UNIX entities and thus there is not yet a Windows implementation
 *  for this class.

    // can be pretty huge. Hence we fork at the start of SCIRun and create a
    // child connected by a simple pipe. This separate child process will be
    // used to fork external applications. As it is created before any dynamically
    // loaded libraries and processes and as well beore a lot of dynamic allocations
    // have been made, the core of this fork should be small. Hence any process we fork
    // from this process is small in memory terms as well.
