The steps involved in installing the XML::Simple module for perl :

1. Download from http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/G/GR/GRANTM/XML-Simple-2.14.tar.gz

2. Extract the file,

$ tar zxvf XML-Simple-2.14.tar.gz


3. Get into the directory and issue the following commands

$ cd XML-Simple-2.14

$ perl Makefile.PL

$ make 

$ make test

Change into root and run (if you don't have root privileges, see step 4)

root$ make install

4. If you don't have root, do this

Create a directory called "perl" in your home directory and use it as the prefix for your make file 

$ perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/csafe/harman/perl

$ make

$ make test

$ make install

Now, to make perl look for the module in your home directory add the following line in your .cshrc file

setenv PERL5LIB '/home/csafe/harman/perl/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0:/home/csafe/harman/perl/lib/site_perl'


source the .cshrc once and you are good to run the script. 


NOTE: Sometimes if perl is unable to find the perl module that you just installed, try adjusting the PERL5LIB path to where it has the simple.pm file. It might work.
