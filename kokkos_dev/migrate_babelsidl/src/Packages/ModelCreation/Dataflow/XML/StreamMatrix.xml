      Stream Data from a file on disk without loading the data into memory.
      This module extracts a one or more vectors from a matrix stored on disk.
      There are three methods of determining which columns or rows need to be
      extracted:
      </p>
      <p>
      (1) One can use the movie buttons in the GUI to set a start and end index
      and as well the current index. One can automatically step through the 
      different vectors using the buttons in the GUI. The GUI also allows for 
      setting the timing of reloading a new vector. This way one can select only
      one vector at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
      (2) One can supply a matrix with the indices of the vectors to extract. This
      can be one index or can be multiple. The matrix with the indices need to be
      connected to the 'Indices' input port. The order of the indices is kept when
      assigning them in the output matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
      (3) One can supply weights that can are used to extract columns or rows and then
      sum them together using the assigned weights. When using the weights, one does not
      need to supply indices. The indices of the rows or columns to be retrieved from 
      disk are the columns in the weights matrix with a weight assigned. To obtain multple
      weighted outputs, one can assign a weights matrix with multiple rows. Internally
      in the module, the weights matrix will be translated into a sparse matrix. For
      optimal performance one should input a sparse matrix. This option is intended for
      mapping matrices, where one slices a small piece of a large mesh and wants to 
      extract the signals assigned to that part of the mesh.
      </p>
      <p>
      The module outputs the vector or matrix with the selected columns or rows. The module
      also outputs the selected indices. This port can be used to slave other StreamMatrix
      modules to read the same indexed data from different data files. The module also
      output the scaled index, which is the index multiplied with the spacing information
      stored in the data file. This port can be used to extract the time from the file
      automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
      The file with the streaming data needs to be in the uncompressed NRRD format. This
      format uses a text file to describe a data set distributed over multiple files.
      See teem.sourceforge.net for a description of the NRRD file format.
