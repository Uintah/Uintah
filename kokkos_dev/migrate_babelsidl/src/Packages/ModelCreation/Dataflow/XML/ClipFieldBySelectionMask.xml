      Clip away the section of the mesh that is not selected in the SelectionMask. 
      This function accepts both a selection of elements as well a selection of 
      nodes. The module automatically detects whether elements are selected or
      nodes, depending on the size of the SelectionMask. If the number of 
      elements is equal to the number of nodes, the basis order of the original 
      field will determine hoe the SelectionMask is interpreted. The SelectionMask
      is a matrix column vector that has zeros for the element/nodes that are not
      selected and entries with a number not equal to zero for the elements/nodes
      that are selected. 
      In case nodes are selected all elements are cut away that have not all nodes
      selected.
