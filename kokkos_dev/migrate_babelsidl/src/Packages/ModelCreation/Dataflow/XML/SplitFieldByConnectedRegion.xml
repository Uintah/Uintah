      This module splits a field into a series of fields in which every field
      contains a segment of the field that was not topologically connected to the
      other parts of the field. Thos module can for example be used to split a
      surface separating different domains in a set of surfaces that are not
      topologically connected. The out of this module is a bundle with the set
      of fields.
