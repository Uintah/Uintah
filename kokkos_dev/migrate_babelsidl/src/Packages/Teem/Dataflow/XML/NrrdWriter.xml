    <summary>Output the NrrdData object via Pio.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>Save a serialized NrrdData object, which in turn saves the
nrrd file that it wraps.  So the end result is two saved files. Note
that these files live side by side, the NrrdData will not load
properly if they are moved, as it holds the full path to the nrrd it
wraps. The .nrrd file can of course be relocated on its own, and used
as any other nrrd independently from the NrrdData (.nd) file.</p>
      <p>To save out just a nrrd or some other format, use <modref
package="Teem" name="UnuSave"/>.</p>
