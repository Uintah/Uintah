    <summary>The FieldBoundary module extracts a boundary surface from
a volume field.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        The FieldBoundary module extracts the bounding surface of the
incoming field, making it into a new field that it outputs through the
BoundaryField port.  This module does not have a GUI. It has one input
port, Input, and two output ports, Boundary, and Mapping. The
FieldBoundary module builds an appropriate mesh from the incoming
field.  FieldBoundary will build a QuadSurfMesh, TriSurfMesh, or
CurveMesh as appropriate for the boundary type of the input field. The
Boundary output port will contain the new boundary mesh with no data
interpolated onto it.  If the data from the input field is desired on
the output field, we recommended that using the Mapping output,
running the results through <modref package="SCIRun"
name="ApplyMappingMatrix"/> in order to draw values from the input
field.
       </p>

      <developer>
	<p>Any interior face should be shared by two cells.  The
boundary surface is calculated as the module checks each face that is
shared by two or more cells. The faces that exist in one cell only are
boundary faces.  This module can be used as a debugging tool becuase
errors or holes in the mesh will show up as boundary faces.</p>

      <p>Use the FieldBoundary module to extract just the outside
shell of the sphere module, then use <modref package="SCIRun"

onto the boundary.</p>

      <p>Convert the sphere data set into a HexVol, then test
FieldBoundary on that HexVol to make sure that a QuadSurf is created
successfully. Then chop a chunk of that closed QuadSurf boundary out
and test FieldBoundary on that to make sure that the edge of the cut
is properly clipped out.  See also FieldBoundary-tritest.net</p>
