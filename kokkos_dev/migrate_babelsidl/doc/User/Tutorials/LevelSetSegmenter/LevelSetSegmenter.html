      <h2>Section 1&mdash;Introduction</h2>

      <p>
      LevelSetSegmenter is a program that segments three dimensional scalar data. Users load a volume, crop it if needed, smooth it, and then segment it slice by slice using the ThresholdLevelSetSegmentationImageFilter from the <a href="http://www.itk.org/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1ThresholdSegmentationLevelSetImageFilter.html">Insight Toolkit</a>. The resulting segmented volume can then be volume rendered using SCIRun's new volume rendering modules.
      </p>

      <a name="section_2" id="section_2"/>
      <h2>Section 2&mdash;Getting Started</h2> 
      <p>
	This section demonstrates how to start LevelSetSegmenter. Subsequent
	sections demonstrate how to load, crop, smooth, and segment data.
      </p>

      <h3>
	<a name="section_2_1" id="section_2_1">2.1 Launching
	  LevelSetSegmenter</a>
      </h3> 
      <p>
	To launch the LevelSetSegmenter application, change the current
	working directory (using the <b>cd</b> command) to the
	directory containing the
	LevelSetSegmenter executable.  
	</p>
      <p>
	Type <tt>./LevelSetSegmenter</tt> to start the program.  LevelSetSegmenter takes
	a few moments to start up, then launches a user interface window
	shown in <a href="#figure_1">Figure 1</a>.  
      </p> 

      <a name="figure_1" id="figure_1"></a>
      <center>
	<a href="figures/load.gif">
	  <img border="1"
	    src="figures/load-small.gif" width="600" height="439" alt="Figure 1: LevelSetSegmenter
	    Interface Window (Initial State)."/> 
	</a>
	<br/>
	<b>Figure 1: LevelSetSegmenter Interface Window initial
	  state  <br />Click on image for a larger view</b>
      </center>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p>
      The LevelSetSegmenter can also be started with three optional arguments: a load file, a binary save file, and a floating point save file.  One, two, or all three of these arguments can be given but they must be in the above order.
      </p>
      <p>
      The load file can be a NRRD formatted file (See the <a href="http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/index.html">NRRD web site</a> for information on this data format), or a single Analyze file.  <b>NOTE:</b> The LevelSetSegmenter can also read in dicom files using the application user interface but is unable to load them in via the command line at this time.
      </p>
      <p>The binary and floating point save files must be in either Analyze or META format.
      </p>

      <p>
      An example of starting the application with arguments would be to use something like the following command:
      </p>
      <p>
      <tt>./LevelSetSegmenter /usr/sci/data/king_filt.hdr ~/binary.hdr ~/float.hdr</tt>
      </p>

      <h3>
	<a name="section_2_2" id="section_2_2">2.2 User
	  Interface Organization</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
      LevelSetSegmenter's user interface, shown in <a href="#figure_1">
      Figure 1</a>, contains two main panes.  The left pane is the Processing
      Pane.  It guides the user through processing the data (loading, cropping,
      smoothing, segmenting, volume rendering). 
      </p>
      <p>
      The right pane is the Visualization Pane and contains four 
      viewing windows. The top left window will contain the original
      data, with the current seed or segmentation in red, and will be 
      referred to as the Segmentation window.  The top
      right window will contain the original data with the speed image
      in red and blue as an overlay, and will further be referred to as
      the Speed window.  The bottom left window will contain
      a slice by slice view of the original or smoothed data, called the Slice
      window,  and the bottom right window will contain any volume rendering images.
      </p>

      <p>
	The panes may be "detached" from one another by clicking on the
	pane detachment/attachment controls&mdash;these are the vertical dashed
	lines separating the panes.  When separated, the panes appear as shown
	in <a href="#figure_2">Figure 2</a> <a name="figure_2"
	  id="figure_2"></a>.  Detaching the Rendering window allows it to
	be viewed at maximum resolution.  Panes are re-attached by 
	clicking on the pane detachment/attachment controls.
      </p>

	The Processing Pane has two top-level menus: File and Help, as
	shown in <a href="#figure_3">Figures 3</a> and <a
	  href="#figure_4">4</a>. 
      </p>

      <p>
	File menu items Save Session... and Load Session... allow the
	user to stop and resume LevelSetSegmenter sessions.  After loading a
	saved session with Load Session..., resume processing and
	visualization by clicking Execute.
      </p>

      <p>
	Help menu item Show Tooltips toggles tooltips. "Hovering" the
	mouse pointer over a control
	displays a tooltip describing a control.

      <p>
	The bottom of the Processing Pane contains a Progress
	Indicator, a text description indicating the current
	state of the application, and suggests the next processing
	step.
      </p>

      <p>
	The Progress Indicator  indicates an error if an error occurs.  Clicking
	on the Progress Indicator displays an error log.

      <h2>
	Section 3&mdash;Loading Data
      </h2>

      <p>
	LevelSetSegmenter supports the NRRD, Analyze, and DICOM data 
	formats. One option for loading data is to specify the filename 
	as a command line argument when starting the app. 
	</p>
	<p>
	When loading a NRRD file, use the Browse button to invoke a 
	file selection dialog like the one shown in <a href="#figure_5">
	Figure 5</a>. After selecting the desired file,
	click the Set button in the file selection dialog.  The UI will close.
      </p>

      <p>
      To load a series of dicom files, change the Data file Format tab to 
      Dicom and open the file dialog by pressing the Dicom Loader button. 
      This interface allows the user to specify a directory where a series
      of dicom files are located.  After specifying a directory, a list of
      available series will appear in the left window, and a list of files
      corresponding with the currently selected series appears on the right.
      The user can click a single series or individual files and then select
      the Add Data button.  The selected data will appear in the bottom window.
      When the user is done loading the desired files, click Close to hide
      the dialog.
      </p>

      <p>
      To load an Analyze file, change the Data file Format tab to Analyze
      and open the Analyze dialog by pressing the Analyze Loader button.
      A dialog similar to the one shown in <a href="#figure_6">Figure 6</a>
      will appear. 
      Use the Browse button to browse to an Analyze file.  Click the Add
      Data button to add the data to the list of selected data at the bottom.
      For the LevelSetSegmenter, either load a single 3D analyze file, or
      several 2D slice Analyze files. Click the Close button to dismiss the 
      dialog.

	After selecting a 3D volume, click the Processing Pane's Load
	button.  The volume is loaded and an image appears
	in the Slice window as shown in <a href="#figure_7">Figure 7</a>. 
	This image shows the 
	original data in a slice by slice mode looking down the Z axis.  
	The smoothing will be done on each Z slice as well as each 2D Z slice
	will be passed to be segmented. To change which axis is processed,
	use the radiobuttons labeled View Slices Along.

	Section 4.1&mdash;Cropping
      </h3> 

      <p>
        Sometimes it may be useful to crop the original data to a 
	specific region of interest, or to crop the volume while
	tweaking smoothing parameters to reduce the processing time.
	By default, the volume will not be cropped.
      </p>
      <p>
       To crop the volume, turn on the cropping widget by clicking the 
       Show Crop Widget checkbox. A green box will appear over the entire
       volume in the Slice window as shown in <a href="#figure_9">Figure 9</a>.
       The extents of the cropping boxes present a visual indication of
       data remaining after the application of the cropping filter.  A
       cropping box can be resized by clicking and dragging a box's
       corner or side.  A box can be moved by clicking and dragging its
       interior.  
      </p>

      Pane change to reflect the position of the widget.  Users can
      manually change the values using the entry boxes in the Processing
      Pane and when hitting Enter in the box, the widget will update.
      </p>

      When the desired region has been selected, click the Crop button.
      The new volume will appear in the Slice window as shown in 
      <a href="#figure_10">Figure 10</a>.

      <h3>Section 4.2&mdash;Smoothing
      </h3>

      <p>
      Notice that once a crop has been performed, the radiobutton in the
      Smoothing frame changes from Smooth Entire Volume, to Smooth Region
      of Interest.  The user can continue to process the cropped volume
      (i.e. smooth it and then segment just the cropped region), or once
      the smoothing parameters have been determined, change the smoothing
      radiobutton to Smooth Entire Volume.
      </p>

      <p>
      By default, no smoothing is done to the volume.  Smoothing filters
      currently available in the LevelSetSegmenter are the
      <a href="http://www.itk.org/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1GradientAnisotropicDiffusionImageFilter.html">GradientAnisotropicDiffusionImageFilter</a>,
      <a href="http://www.itk.org/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1CurvatureAnisotropicDiffusionImageFilter.html">CurvatureAnisotropicDiffusionImageFilter</a>,
      and the <a href="http://www.itk.org/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1DiscreteGaussianImageFilter.html">DiscreteGaussianImageFilter</a> 
      from the <a href="http://www.itk.org">Insight Toolkit</a>. Use the
      option menu to select the desired filter.  Notice that the interface
      changes to be specific to the selected smoothing method.  
      </p>

      <p>
      Selecting the Gaussian filter, with a variance of 10 and a Maximum 
      Error of 0.001, and pressing the Reset button produces the resulting
      volume as shown in <a href="#figure_11">Figure 11</a>.

	<b>Figure 11: Applying the DiscreteGaussian filter to the volume.</b>
      </center>
      <br/><br/>

      <p>
      To use the
      original volume as the input to the smoothing filter, select the Reset
      button.  If the user has all ready done at least one smoothing pass,
      and wants the output of the smoothing filter to be the input to 
      another pass of smoothing, select the Go button.  The Go button allows
      smoothing to be additive in respect to the last smoothing pass.
      </p>

      <p>
      To make the edges even more clear, use the GradientAnistropicDiffusion
      filter.  By selecting this filter now, with a time step of 0.0625,
      with 10 iterations, and a conductance of 0.5, and then using the Go
      button to feed the blurred volume into the filter, the resulting
      volume looks like <a href="#figure_12">Figure 12</a>.

      To compare the original data, with the smoothed data, toggle between
      the Show Original and Show Smoothed radiobuttons in the Smoothing
      frame. Click the Next button to move on to segmentation.

      <h2>Section 5&mdash;Segmentation
      </h2>

      <p>
      When first changing to the Segmentation Tab, notice that images
      now appear in the top viewing windows.  The top left window, the
      Segmentation window, will show the current slice, current seed, and
      current segmentation.  The right window, the Speed window, will show
      the Speed image which will help the user to adjust the Level Set
      parameters for a good segmentation. The Segmentation Tab looks like

      At the top of the Segmentation Tab, are the current slice widgets.
      To the left is an indicator representing the state of the current slice.
      A red circle means that no segmentation has been committed for the 
      current slice.  When a slice is committed, the indicator will turn
      green meaning the segmentation shown and the segmentation in the commit
      volume are in sync.  After committing a segmentation, if the user
      then runs the level set segmentation process again, the indicator
      will turn yellow meaning that the commit volume and the currently
      viewed segmentation are out of sync. 
      </p>
      <p>
      After obtaining the desired 
      segmentation and committing it to the final volume (which will be
      discussed later in this chapter), change the current working slice
      by changing the Segmenting Slice value and pressing the Change Slice
      button.

      <h3>Section 5.1&mdash;Tuning the Speed Image
      </h3>

      <p>
      By tuning the level set paramters, and updating the Speed image,
      users can set the level set parameters to be reasonable values
      for their segmentation.  Try adjusting the upper and lower thresholds
      and selecting the Update Speed Image button and notice how the Speed
      window changes.  Areas of red show where growth will occur and areas
      of blue show where the segmentation will shrink.  Setting the Reverse
      Expansion Direction to on, will reverse the behavior - causing areas of
      red to shrink and areas of blue to grow.  For more information regarding
      the level set Equation Term Weights see the <a href="http://www.itk.org/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1ThresholdSegmentationLevelSetImageFilter.html">
      Level Set documentation</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      To pull out the region of white in our current slice, change the
      lower and upper thresholds to 176 and 183 respectively. After
      pressing the Update Speed Image button, the following speed image
      will appear in the Speed window as shown in <a href="#figure_14">
      Figure 14</a>.

      <h3>Section 5.2&mdash;Creating the Seed Image
      </h3>

      <p>
      The options for seeding the segmentation are using the previous,
      current, or next segmentation, using a binary thresholded volume,
      or using seed points only.  These options are found in the Initial
      Segmentation frame. Note that users cannot use a current segmentation
      if they haven't all ready committed one for the current slice. Also
      note that seed points will always be used in conjunction with the
      selected seeding method.  To remove seed points, set the number
      of seed points to 0.
      </p>

      <p>
      To add/subtract seed points, press the '+'/'-' buttons.  Positive
      seeds points will add to the current seed while negative seed points
      will subtract the region under the ring widget from the current seed.
      Positive seed points are shown as red ring widgets while negative
      seed points are blue widgets.  Note that as additional seed points
      are added, they will appear overlapping eachother in the bottom 
      left corner of the Segmentation viewer image.  Press the Shift key while
      clicking on a seed point widget and drag the widget to the desired
      location.  Shift click on the green indicators around a seed point
      to resize the seed point ring.
      </p>

      <p>
      After selecting the desired seeding method combination, click the
      Update Initial Segmentation button to see the seed image.  For example,
      after adding six positive seed rings, the following seed image will
      be the result, <a href="#figure_15">Figure 15</a>.

      <h3>Section 5.3&mdash;Segmenting the Slice
      </h3>

      <p>
      Before starting the segmentation, set the Maximum Number of Iterations
       and the Maximum RMS Error.  Just as the smoothing section had a
       Reset and Go button, so does the segmentation section.  Reset
       will take the seed volume as specified in the Initial Segmentation
       frame as the input seed, while Go will take the last segmentation 
       pass on the current slice as the input seed.  In using Go, with
       each pass, users can feed seeds that more closely match the desired
       segmentation into the level set filter. After each filter iteration,
       the Segmentation window will update with the current segmentation.
      </p>

      <p>
      If the segmentation is taking longer and not producing the desired
      result, users can hit the Stop button to stop the segmentation process.
      </p>

      <p>
      After running the above six seeds with 100 iterations and a maximum
      error of 0.02, the segmentation intermediate outputs are shown in 
      <a href="#figure_16">Figure 16</a> in the Segmentation window.
      </p>

	<br/>
	<b>Figure 16: Segmentation intermediate outputs.</b>
      </center>
      <br/><br/>

      <p>
      To commit this segmentation to the final volume, click the
      yellow Commit button in the Segment frame.  Notice that the
      slice indicator at the top of the tab turns to green denoting
      that the current segmentation is in sync with what has been 
      committed.      
      </p>

      <p>
      To change to the next slice, increment the Segmenting Slice to
      1 and hit the Change Slice button.  All three viewing windows
      will change.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Continue segmenting each slice.  The Use Previous seeding method 
      may be most useful.  Remember to commit your segmentations for
      each slice.
      </p>

      <h2>Section 6&mdash;Volume Rendering and Saving Results
      </h2>

      <p>
      Notice that after the first commit, the Update Volume Rendering
      button is enabled, as well as the Save Binary and Save Float buttons.
      For best results with volume rendering, do not press the Update
      Volume Rendering button until all of the slices have been segmented
      and committed. Once the entire volume has been segmented, click the
      Update Volume Rendering button and a volume rendering will appear
      in the Volume Rendering window in the bottom right as shown in 
      <a href="#figure_17">Figure 17</a>. To toggle between viewing the
      segmentation and the background, use the Show Segmentation and
      Show Background radiobuttons respectively.
      </p>

      <p><b>
      Note that this tutorial is only using a volume with 5 slices.
      </b></p>

      <p>
      There are two options for saving out results.  First is the binary
      volume, where segmented regions contain a value of 1 and background
      contains a value of 0.  This file should either be an analyze (.hdr) or 
      META (.mhd or .mha) file.  To specify the filename, type it into the
      entry or use the Browse button to navigate to it.  To resave the
      volume, click the Save Binary button. 
      </p>

      <p>
      The Level Set filter produces a float volume as ouput.  To save
      this volume, do the same as saving the binary output, but use the 
      float volume controls.
      </p>

      <p>Future versions of the LevelSetSegmenter will allow users to 
      load in previously saved segmentations into the app and continue
      to refine the segmentation.
