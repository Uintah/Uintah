models:
 - add sources in ice
 - sort out material sets
 - read models
 - create simple model
 - make labels


restart
DONE track down using std somewhere
DONE AMR gets for coarse regions - move into DW...
reallocation...
2 proc/27 patch problems
ice1: failed to scrub vel_CC
watch out for patches >= processes in AMR run
fix reductions for patches < processors
What is a non-data dependency??? they are too strong for remote patches?
fix checkput/checkget/checkaccess stuff
saves for multi-level reductions
Combine grid reading between SimulationController and AMRSimulationController
Poisson2 broken...

Nix d_computes in task
Fix getOtherLevelPatches to not use Point to move between levels...
What is d_requires and d_requiresOldDW in Task???
merge differnet DWdatabases???
initRequires and initRequiredVars both necessary????
What happened to dependency batches - is map really necessary???
Also - toTasks in DependencyBatch - is that necessary?
saving of multiple reduction variables
make a "loadbalancer common" for createNeighborhood
output at intermediate timesteps????
Automatic grid refinement
test other schedulers (for older problems too)
Put other scheduler tests in regression tester?
Compile speed for AMR stuff
AMRBurger?
Move SimulationController port to Ports
Make refine only require data from coarser patch in overlapping region
Make coarsen only require data from finer patch in overlapping region
get rid of all #if 0s

DONE Check simple loadbalancer for AMR...
DONE check for two tasks that compute the same result...
DONE Do not create Detailed Deps in single processor scheduler
DONE Move createScrub counts out of createDetaileddeps
DONE fix g++ .d empty problem with rm of .o before compile
DONE scrubbing for MPI not right!!!
DONE Lots of things crash at end with delt problem
DONE test MPIScheduler
DONE is cleanForeign/isForeign/setForeign still necessary???
DONE Why DWs 2/4???
DONE ScrubFull ->ScrubComplete
DONE lam problems with particle variables...
DONE scheduling multiple reductions
DONE new scheduling parameters for reductions?
DONE Reductions may be messed up
DONE check detailedtask creation for reductions with levels
DONE Print out level for reduction variable requires instead of patches
DONE Massive number of requires in poisson3_3level_multipatch
DONE debugstream out of DWDatabase
DONE Make refineInterface only require data from coarserPatch at boundaries
DONE redo impmpm
DONE redo poisson2
DONE get rid of asssumesDataInNdwDW
DONE get rid of set_dw in scheduler
DONE determine what explicit scrub means...
DONE maptofiner/maptocoarser
DONE level 1, residual always 0???
DONE remove print statements
DONE Move push/pop running 
DONE other scheduler stuff out of DW interface
DONE how to get other dws
DONE poisson3_3level_8patch - too aggressive scrubbing...
DONE check scrubbing in DWDatabase dtor...
DONE slight memory leak
DONE enable/disable scrubbing in DW instead of in scheduler
DONE Do not ignore scrubs on intermediate DWs
DONE scrubbing...
DONE output
DONE index dwdatabase by patch id, not patch*
DONE get scrubcount out of DataWarehouse interface
DONE Look at what addIfZero is/does
DONE refineInterface for Poisson3
DONE Get rid of all (most) referenced to OldDW and NewDW in Scheduler
DONE Fix index spaces for fine levels!!!

petsc interface
DONE check scrubbing...
DONE check checkpoint/restart

AMR:
DONE - Rethink - output introduces a major can of worms....
DONE - Some way for output, amr to tell it NOT to scrub?
DONE - Output for AMR data
DONE - puda for AMR
 - Vis tools for AMR
 - Error criteria
 - remeshing


Fix oport in scheduler

Particle motion limit to config file?

C++ header file patches for everyone

Classes:
 - DataWarehouse/scheduler in detail
 - Peformance analysis
Flag -nooutput
Profile/optimize
Fix boundary/initial condition stuff
Parallelism
More info in xml files:
 - variable min/max for some types
Optimize!
semi-consistent struct printou

Malloc: return large chunks under memory pressure
large pages

constHandle?

7. PSE integration
  - sort out handles/RefCounted
