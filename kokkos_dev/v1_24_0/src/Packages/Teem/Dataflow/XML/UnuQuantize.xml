    <summary>Quantize values into 8, 16, 32 bit values.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>Given an input nrrd, output a nrrd that is of type unsigned
char, unsigned short, unsigned int (8,16,32 bit) values.  The input
values are clamped to be in the range of the min and max values
specified in the user interface.  By default, the min and max of the
input will be used.  This is indicated by the 'Use lowest/highest value
of input as min/max'.  To specify different min max, uncheck the above checkbox
and input the values in the entry. The current min/max values will be displayed
after initial execution.</p>
