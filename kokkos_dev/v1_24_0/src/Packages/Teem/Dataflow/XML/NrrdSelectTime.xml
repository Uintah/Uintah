    <summary>
      The NrrdSelectTime module allows users to select a single time
step or column from a NrrdData that has a time axis.  The user can
also select a range of time indecies and send them to the output port
one at a time.  This module allows the user to animate Through a time
series.
    </summary>
    <description>
	<p>When the module runs in interactive mode, the user selects
which vectors they want to include in the playback.  In the
NrrdSelectTime module dialog window, Start and End sliders enable the
user to set the playback range, the Current Value function specifies
which row or column to send downstream, and the Delay function
controls the time delay and speed of the animated points on the
mesh.</p>
      
      <p>There are several Play Modes in the NrrdSelectTime GUI
dialog window: Once, Loop, Bounce1, and Bounce2.  The Once mode plays
the animation from current value to the end of the selected range of
column and rows on the matrix.  The Loop mode plays the selected range
endlessly, reversing directions after reaching the start or end of the
range.  Bounce1 only plays endpoints once, while Bounce2 repeats them.
For example, if the range is 1 through 3, Bounce1 will play { 1 2 3 2
1 2 3 2 1 . . .}, while Bounce2 will play {1 2 3 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 1}.
Using the Delay text field in the GUI dialog window, the user
specifies a delay (in milliseconds) that controls the speed at which
the selected rows or columns may be sent to the output port.</p>
      
      <p>The Increment entry can be used to skip through the input
matrix by more than one element at a time.  This can be used with the
Send Amount entry to send more than one row/column at a time. For
instance, if both entries are set to three, the module will send three
rows/columns at a time, which can then be mapped onto a vector field
by the <modref package="SCIRun" name="ManageFieldData"/> module. </p>
