    <summary>Create an output nrrd that is a subsample of the
original.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>Crop preserves dimension.  After first execution, the user interface has
correct values, and will perform a crop that produces the identical
nrrd as was input. The min and max pairs per axis in the user
interface are the sample indecies that you wish to crop. In the case that the min or max are out of bounds, the min and max will reset to the bounding box and the input nrrd will be output.</p>
