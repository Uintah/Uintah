      <p>EditColorMap2D is used for interactively creating and
editing ColorMap2 transfer functions for use in volume visualization.
These are two dimensional colormaps where the horizontal axis
represents the scalar values of the data and the vertical axis
represents the gradient magnitude.  For example a narrow vertical bar
that cuts across the colormap selects all the elements in the data
with that value and results in an approximate isosurface (it's not
quite a surface as it has volume depending upon the narrowness of the
band).  A vertical bar would represent a particular rate of change within the volume and could be used to highlight boundaries between objects or areas of high flow.</p>

      <p>The ColorMap2 is painted by dragging various widgets around to cover the points of interest in the data.  In addition an optional ColorMap2 can be generated elsewhere (See <modref package="SCIRun" name="ColorMap2Reader"/> and <modref package="SCIRun" name="NrrdToColorMap2"/> and passed into the appropriate input port.  The second Histogram port is also optional and should contain a join histogram of the scalar values and gradient magnitudes.  It should be a 512x256 grayscale image (and must contain unsigned character data) that is displayed in the background of the ColorMap2 for reference purposes.</p>
