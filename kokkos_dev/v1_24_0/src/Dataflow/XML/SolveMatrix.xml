    <summary>The SolveMatrix module is used to solve the linear system
    Ax=b, where A is a given Matrix, b is a given right-hand-side
    vector, and the user wants to find the solution vector x.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>We support several different iteratve solution techniques
      within SCIRun, including Jacobi, Conjugate Gradient, and
      Biconjugate Gradient.
      </p>
      <p>As the module iteratively approaches the solution, a
      graphical user interface depicts the norm of the residual.  This
      feedback allows the user to visually confirm whether a solution
      is converging, and if so how quickly.  It also provides a
      convenient interface for specifying a convergrence threshold, as
      the user can interactively raise of lower the maximum acceptable
      error tolerance in real-time.  As the solver is converging, the
      module can send out the current guess at the solution and
      continue to iterate; this intermediate result is passed
      downstream to dependent modules, and can be useful for
      visualizing how a system is physically converging.
