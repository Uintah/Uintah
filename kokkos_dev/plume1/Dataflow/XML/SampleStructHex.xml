    <description>

      <p> Make a StructHexVolField that fits the source field.  The
      value type of the LatVolField is the same as that of the input
      field.  If there is no input field specified, then create a unit
      volume of doubles.  The size parameters refer to the number of
      nodes in the volume, not the number of cells.  Thus a 2x2x2 node
      lattice will only contain one cell. </p>

      <p> The Pad Percentage parameter is an optional parameter that
      describes how much larger than the input field the resulting
      lattice volume should be.  For example, a value of 100 would
      make the lattice volume be three times as far across and contain
      twenty seven times the volume of a lattice with the default 0
      padding.  A value of 50 would cause the lattice to be twice as
      far across (50% bigger on each side).  </p>

      <p> No interpolation is done onto the new field.  It is
      recommended that the <modref package="SCIRun" name="DirectMapping"/> module be used if those
      values are needed. </p>

      <p> The default appearance of this field is not much different than that
      produced by the <modref package="SCIRun" name="SampleLattice"/>.  However the points can be moved
      independently of each other such that primitive modeling can be
      done in conjunction with the <modref package="SCIRun" name="ManageFieldMesh"/> module.  See the
      SampleStructHex.net sample network for an example. </p>

<p>Create and draw a StructHexVolField using the SampleStructHex module.
The default StructHexVolField created by the module is visually
indistinguishable from the lattice created by <modref package="SCIRun" name="SampleLattice"/>, so this network
shows off the capabilities of the StructHexVolField by using the
<modref package="SCIRun" name="ManageFieldMesh"/> module to transform the points into a low-distortion
cylinder.</p>

<p>This network can be found at src/nets/Modules/FieldsCreate/SampleStructHex-cylinder.net.</p>
