      <p>
	Convert a LatVolField into a MaskedLatVolField and apply the
        given function to mask it out.  This is similar to the
        behavior of the <modref package="SCIRun" name="ClipByFunction"/> module, except that the input field
        is masked rather than clipped out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The function should be a valid C++ expression.  It will be
	dynamically compiled into a function of the form "bool
        inside_p(double x, double y, double z, TYPE v) { return EXPR; }"
        where TYPE is the data type contained in the field, and EXPR is the
        function typed into the GUI.

<p>Use the MaskLattice module to mask away a portion of an input lattice
and display it against the original to verify that it has been masked.</p>
