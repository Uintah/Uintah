    <summary>Convert a HexVolField into a TetVolField.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        Given a Hex field (or anything that supports the same interface)
	as input, produce a TetVol as output -- each Hex element gets
        split into 5 Tets.  In order to produce consistent splits across
        faces, we alternate between two different templates for how to do
        the split.  Currently HexVolMesh, StructHexVolMesh, and
        LatVolMesh fields can be converted into TetVolMeshes.

<title>HexToTet-hex Regression Test</title>

<p>Convert a Hexahedral field into a Tetrahedral field using the HexToTet
module, and draw both the Hex and Tet fields for reference.  The code
for converting the various hexahedral meshes into tets is different
internally, so we do the tests for each of the various hexahedral
field types independently.  There should be no visual difference
between the results of these three test networks.</p>
