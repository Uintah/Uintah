    <p> Format: output file format. Possibilities include:
     nrrd : standard nrrd format;
     png : PNG image;
     pnm : PNM image; PPM for color, PGM for grayscale;
     text : plain ASCII text for 1-D and 2-D data;
     vtk : VTK "STRUCTURED_POINTS" dataset;
     eps : EPS file</p>
     <p>Encoding : encoding of data in file. Not all encodings are supported in
     a given format. Possibilities include:
     raw : raw encoding;
     ascii : print data in ascii;
     hex : two hex digits per byte</p>
    <p>Endian : Endianness to save data out as; little for Intel and
     friends; big for everyone else. Defaults to endianness of
     this machine.</p>
