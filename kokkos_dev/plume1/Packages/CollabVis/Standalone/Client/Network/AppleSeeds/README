README for AppleSeeds

This directory contains AppleSeeds, a set of utilities intended to ease the
development of AppLeS (Application Level Schedulers). These utilities support
AppLeS development projects by: 

  Encapsulating system-dependent code so that AppLeS code can be ported between
    architectures without modification. 
  Hiding some of the grimier details of system calls behind a convenient set
    of abstractions.
  Providing general-use utility packages that make AppLeS easier to develop
    and use. 

See Doc/introduction for installation instructions, and the individual
AppleSeeds header files for information on use.  The documentation is
reproduced, in somewhat easier-to-read form, on the UCSD Grid Computing Lab
web page, http://gridlab.ucsd.edu/appleseeds
