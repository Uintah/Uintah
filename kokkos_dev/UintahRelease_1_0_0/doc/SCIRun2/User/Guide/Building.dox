\page building Instructions for Configuring and Building the SCIRun2 Framework and Components

This document describes the process of configuring and building the SCIRun2
research code, including the SCIRun2 framework, GUI, and various
experimental component models.

\section whatis SCIRun2 is not SCIRun

SCIRun2 is not
<a href="http://software.sci.utah.edu/scirun.html">SCIRun</a>.
SCIRun2, however, does currently have dependencies on many of the original
%SCIRun dataflow classes.
Because of these dependencies (and for other historical reasons), building
SCIRun2 also requires building %SCIRun.
Eventually, the original dataflow classes will be isolated from
SCIRun2 and built only as an optional component.

\subsection whatis_1 Supported platform(s)
SCIRun2 code has never been built on anything other than RedHat and SuSE Linux.
In theory, it should be possible to configure SCIRun2 on any Unix-like platform
including MacOS X.

<!--
Building SCIRun2 requires GNU make version 3.79 or better, Autoconf 2.59 (or better?).
-->

\section depend Dependencies

SCIRun2 code has dependencies on multiple third-party software packages.
The table below lists the various code modules available with SCIRun2 and
their dependencies.

Be sure to carefully check the build instructions for each third-party dependency.

\subsection depend_scirun SCIRun

SCIRun2 software is distributed with
\ref whatis "SCIRun".
All required classes build automatically.

\subsubsection depend_scirun_1 SCIRun Thirdparty

This package consists of bundled third-party libraries.
It is freely available (<b>registration required</b>)
<a href="http://software.sci.utah.edu/scirun.html">here</a>.
Select the appropriate <b>Thirdparty source</b> download for your platform.

Estimated time to build: 1 hour

<!-- Deprecated instructions??? -->

Before building SCIRun2, set the following environment variables:
\code
SCIRUN_THIRDPARTY=/path/to/scirun/thirdparty/installation
PATH=$SCIRUN_THIRDPARTY/bin:$PATH</code>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SCIRUN_THIRDPARTY/lib:$LD_LIBARARY_PATH
\endcode

\subsection depend_flex Flex

Flex is widely available in various binary formats for Linux.
Alternatively, source downloads are available from the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> site.

\subsection depend_bison Bison

Bison is widely available in various binary formats for Linux.
Alternatively, source downloads are available from the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> site.

\subsection depend_gawk Gawk

Gawk is widely available in various binary formats for Linux.

<!--
\subsection depend_xml2 xml2

Version ? or better is required...
-->

\subsection depend_ncurses ncurses

Ncurses libraries and development headers need to be available to compile
the text-based builder component (TxtBuilder).

\subsection depend_qt Qt

Qt is necessary if you want to build the graphical user interface to the
SCIRun2 framework (recommended).
A free version of Qt for noncommercial use can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.trolltech.com">www.trolltech.com</a>.
The distributions "qt-x11-free-3.3.x" have been tested.
<em>Be sure to configure and build Qt with multithreading enabled</em>
(<b>Qt configure option -thread</b>).

Estimated time to build: 3-5 hours

Before building SCIRun2, set the following environment variables:
\code
QTDIR=/path/to/qt/installation
PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
\endcode

\subsection depend_babel Babel

The Babel compiler can be freely obtained from
<a href="http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components/babel.html">
www.llnl.gov/CASC/components/babel.html</a>.
SCIRun2 currently supports Babel version 0.11.0.

<!-- All SCIRun2 Babel C++ code uses the Utah C++ bindings. -->

Babel requires Java, at least libxml2 2.4.0 and Python to build the testing
framework.
Please read the Babel install instructions for details.

Estimated time to build: < 1 hour

Before building SCIRun2, set the following environment

\section config Configuring SCIRun2

To build the SCIRun2 framework, add the <b>--enable-scirun2</b> option to the
configure line.
Dependencies for SCIRun2 components are configured by adding
\ref depend "configure options".

The following command line, for example, configures SCIRun2 with the
works.
Also see
<a href = "nightly.sh.txt">this script</a>.

\code
PATH/TO/SCIRun/src/configure  --enable-scirun2
                              --enable-debug
                              --with-thirdparty=$THIRDPARTY
                              --with-babel=$BABELDIR
                              --with-mpi=$MPIDIR
                              --with-ruby=$RUBYDIR
                              --with-vtk=$VTKDIR
