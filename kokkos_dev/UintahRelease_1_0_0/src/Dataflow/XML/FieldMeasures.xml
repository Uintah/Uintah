    <summary>
        Build a densematrix, where each row is a particular measure of
the input Field (e.g. the x-values, or the element size).
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        FieldMeasures outputs a NxM matrix filled with values
associated with the input mesh measures at selected mesh locations.
      </p>
      <p>
	First the user selects the measues location in the top half of
the UI.  The number of measure locations equals the number of rows (N)
in the output matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
	Then the user selects what measures are sampled at each
location in the bottom half of the UI.  The number of measures
selected equals the number of columns (M) in the output matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
	Description of Measures:
      </p>
      <p> X position - The X coordinate of the center of the measure
location.
      </p>
      <p> Y position - The Z coordinate of the center of the measure
location.
      </p>
      <p> Z position - The Z coordinate of the center of the measure
location.
      </p>
      <p> Index - The index used by the code to reference the measure
location.
      </p>
      <p>
	Valence - The # of similar measure locations that share a
connection with the measure location.  This varies by mesh and is not
defned in all circumstances and thus equals 0 in these cases.
      </p>
      <p> Size - The Euclidean Volume of the measure element.  Ex:
length for edges or  0.0 for points.
      </p>
