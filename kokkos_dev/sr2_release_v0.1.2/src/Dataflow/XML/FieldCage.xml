    <summary>The FieldCage Module renders a semented red-green-blue 3D
  grid around an arbitrary field</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
       FieldCage queries the generic mesh interface to get the BBox of the
       Field, and then renders a "cage" of that bounding box.  The user specifies
       nx/ny/nz (number of "bars" in each direction) via text entry in
       UI.  The cage is rendered with red/green/blue lines corresponding to x/y/z.
