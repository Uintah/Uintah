    <summary>Perform a specified functional transform to each pair of
data elements in the two input fields.</summary>
    <description>

      <p>Compute the specified function for each pair of corresponding
data elements in the input fields.  In order to correspond the data
points, this module requires that the two input fields share the same
mesh and have their data at the same location.</p>
  
      <p>The data transform is specified in the GUI as the body of a
C++ function.  The input values to the function are the x, y, and z
positions of the data point, v0 for the first field's data element and
v1 for the second field's data element.  No value is returned, rather
set the 'result' variable to the return type.  For example, "result =
v0 + v1;" would add each of the corresponding elements of the two
fields.</p>

      <title>TransformData2 Regression Test</title>

      <p>Demonstrate usage of the TransformData2 module.  First a
cyclone data set is created by resampling a LatVolField onto a
PointCloud and then using <modref package="SCIRun"
name="TransformData"/> to assign vectors to that PointCloud using a
cylindrical mapping.  A scalar field containing the x position of each
point in the PointCloud is also created.  The two PointCloudField data
sets are then merged using TransformData by recreating a vector for
each point in the PointCloud that contains the direction of the input
vector field and the magnitude of the input scalar field. Finally this
merged field is visualized using <modref package="SCIRun"
name="ShowField"/>.</p>
