    <summary>
      The module solves a discretized model of Laplace's equation in a 3D volume
conductor model using "surface method", given a particular type of boundary condition.  </summary>
    <description>
<p>The specific problem the authors had in mind was the forward problem of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)
which consists of calculating, for a given time instant, the potential distribution
generated at the surface of a specified volume conductor due the presence of some
current sources on the same surface (the module should work for other
problems which fit the same physical description, but has only been tested for forward
EIT.) In surface methods, the different volume conductor regions are
assumed to have a constant and isotropic conductivity, and only the interfaces between the
different regions are triangulated and represented in the numerical model. This module is based on a method
developed in  [i] and uses the "Transfer-Coefficient Approach" or "solid-angle method" developed by Barr et al.
[ii], as extended to include torso inhomogeneities in [iii] and with an improved algorithm
for computing the solid angles [iv]. </p>

      <p>This module requires the triangulated surfaces of all the objects as inputs and
creates the forward solution matrix as output. The geometric relationships of the surfaces
are defined as described below, as are the boundary conditions to apply.</p>

<p>The number of input fields is one or two. The outermost surface is the surface on which Neumann boundary condition is
given where the quantity of interest is the Dirichlet boundary condition which
is to be calculated. </p>

<p>To define the geometric relationships of the various fields, for each of the input
fields use a &quot;SetProperty&quot; module with `Property'=`Inside Conductivity' and `Value' = the
numerical value of the internal conductivity of the corresponding homogeneous region.</p>

<p> The output is the forward solution matrix. This matrix can be multiplied to a
Neumann boundary condition on the outermost surface; to result in the Dirichlet boundary condition on
the same surface. </p>
