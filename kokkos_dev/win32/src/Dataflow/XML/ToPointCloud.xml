      Convert a structured field into an unstructured field for editing.

      <p>
        This converts a LatVolField into a HexVolField, an ImageField into a
        QuadSurfField, or a ScanlineField into a CurveField.  The
        structured meshes are not editable, as that operation does not
        preserve structure.  Data values and locations are preserved
        in the transformation.

<p>Convert an ImageField into a QuadSurfMesh using the ToPointCloud
module.  Then clip out part of the QuadSurfMesh using the
ClipByFunction module and display the two fields for comparison
purposes.</p>
