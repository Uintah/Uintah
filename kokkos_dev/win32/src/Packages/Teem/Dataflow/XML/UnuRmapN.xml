    <summary>
      Map nrrd through *regular* univariate map (colormap). A map is
      regular if the control points are evenly spaced along the domain, and
      hence their position isn't explicitly represented in the map; the axis
      min, axis max, and number of points determine their location.  This is
      an N dimensional mapping in that the fast axis of the nrrd is used to
      look up coordinates in the N or N+1 map.  If the map is of dimension N
      then it is assumed to be grayscale, otherwise all of the fast axis is
      treated as a 'color'.  This module does no interpolation, rather the
      nrrd coordinates should exactly match the range of the colormap nrrd
      dimensions, ie 0-255 for a 1D map of size 256.

      <p>Map nrrd through *regular* univariate map of N dimension (colormap). A
      map is regular if the control points are evenly spaced along the
      domain, and hence their position isn't explicitly represented in
      the map; the axis min, axis max, and number of points determine
      their location.</p>

      <p>This is an N dimensional mapping in that the fast axis of the
      nrrd is used to look up coordinates in the N or N+1 map.  For instance
      if the fast axis is size three, then the map should contain 3
      dimensions for grayscale or 4 dimensions where the fast dimension is
      the 'color'.  It is byte copied so the 'color' can really be any
      opaque data type.</p>

      <p>No interpolation is done by this module.  Instead the mapping
      coordinates should be the exact zero based index into the mapping
      index that is to be used.  For example, given a 1D colormap of size
      256, the input nrrd should contain values between 0 and 255.  The
      output nrrd will have the same dimensionality as the input but the
      data will be replaced with the fast axis data from the input nrrd.</p>
