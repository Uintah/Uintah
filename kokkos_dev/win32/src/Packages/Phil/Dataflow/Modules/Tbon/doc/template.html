<h1>Warnings on templated classes</h1>

This module contains a template class.  Before running the module on 
a data set, check to be sure the data types match.  If they do not, 
you will need to recompile after changing the following declaration in
<i>modulename</i>.cc (usually towards the top of the file):<p>

<center>typedef <i>typeid</i> type;</center><p>

<i>typeid</i> should be changed to match the data type of your data
set (float, unsigned char, etc.).
