  Blurs an image by separable convolution with 
  discrete gaussian kernels. This filter performs 
  Gaussian blurring by separable convolution of an 
  image and a discrete Gaussian operator (kernel).
  This module encapsulates the functionality of the ITK Filter itk::DiscreteGaussianImageFilter.  See the <ulink url="http://www.itk.org">ITK web site</ulink> for detailed information on this filter.
