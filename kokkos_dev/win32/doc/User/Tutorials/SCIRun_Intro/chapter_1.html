    <H2><A name="section-0">Chapter Overview</A></H2>
    
    <p> SCIRun is a <I>modular dataflow programming</I> Problem
    Solving Environment (PSE).  SCIRun has a set of <I>Modules</I>
    that perform specific functions on a data stream.  Each module
    reads data from its input ports, calculates the data, and sends
    new data from output ports.  In SCIRun, a module is represented by
    a rectangular box on the Network Editor canvas.  Data flowing
    between modules is represented by pipes connecting the modules.  A
    group of connected modules is called a Dataflow Network, or
    <I>Net</I> (see <A HREF="#figure-1.3">Figure 1.3</A>).  An
    infinite number of nets can be created, each solving a separate
    problem. Chapter 1 of this tutorial demonstrates the use of SCIRun
    to visualize a tetrahedral mesh. This chapter demonstrates the
    construction of  a network comprised of three standard modules:
    FieldReader, ShowField, and Viewer.  This chapter also instructs the
    user on reading <I>Field</I> data from a file, setting 
    rendering properties for the nodes, edges, and faces (the nodes
    are rendered as blue spheres), and rendering geometry to the
    screen in an interactive ViewWindow.
    
    <H2><A name="section-0a">Before Running SCIRun</A></H2>
    
    <p>Before running the <I>scirun</I> executable, an environment
    needs to be set up.  (For more information about environment
    variables consult the <a
    HREF="../../Guide/usersguide/srug4_4.html#sec:scirundata"><i>User's
    Guide</i> 4.4, "SCIRUN_DATA"</a>.)

    <p> The following environment variables need to be set
        in the shell.  Note: another method of setting these variables is to run SCIRun once so that it will create a .scirunrc file in your home directory.  Then edit this file and uncomment the above variables and point them to your data.  This only needs to be done once.  Environment variables set in the shell will override the .scirunrc values.</p>

    <ul><li value="1.">SCIRUN_DATA: points to the location of the
      SCIRunData directory on the system.  Note: it is assumed the
      SCIRunData directory has been downloaded.  (This is a
      separate download from the SCIRun build.)
      <P>
      <li value="2.0">SCIRUN_DATASET: indicates which dataset to load.
      (Note: example networks built in this tutorial can run
      with a variety of data inputs: <i>e.g.</i>, sphere, brain-EG,
      and utahtorso-lowres.)
    </ul>

    <p> Set these environment variables to the following values (See
        Figures 1.0 (csh/tcsh) and 1.1 (bask,ksh,sh)):
    <ol>
         <li value="1.">Set the SCIRUN_DATA variable to point to
             the location of SCIRunData (as shown in <b>Figure
             1.0</b>). The &quot;path_to_data&quot; should represent
             the directory path where data is stored on the 
             computer (<i>e.g.</i>, /usr/local/SCIRunData/1.20.0).
          <P>
          <li value="2.">Set the SCIRUN_DATASET variable to
             &quot;utahtorso-lowres&quot;.
    </ol>
  <center>
  <p><img height="200" width="516" src="images/figures/1_2.gif"><br>

  <b>Figure 1.1: Setup using a Borne-style shell (bash, ksh, sh).</b></p>
  </center>

  <P><B>Running SCIRun</B></P>

  Once these environment variables have been set, 
  SCIRun is ready to run:

  <p>
  <ul>
    <li> Move into the SCIRun executable directory and enter the
    command <b>scirun</b>.  (Note: SCIRun cannot run as a background
    application.)
    <p>
    <li>The SCIRun NetworkEditor window will appear on the screen (see
    Figure 1.2.)  The NetworkEditor screen consists of three frames:
    the GlobalView frame in the upper left corner, the Message frame in
    the upper right corner, and the NetEdit frame. The NetEdit frame
    is the large area where networks of modules are constructed.
    Since the NetEdit frame is extensive, the GlobalView frame shows
    which part of the NetEdit frame is currently being viewed. The
    Message frame reports errors, warnings, and important information.
  </ul>

    Guide</i> 4.2, "Anatomy of the Main Window"</a>.</p>

   <B>SCIRun Network Building Blocks: Modules and Connections</B>

   <p>Lets begin constructing the network pictured in
   <b>Figure 1.3</b>. (Note: subsequent tutorial chapters expand on
   this network, adding more features and functionality.)  This
   network loads a geometric mesh from a data file and renders it to
   the screen.

    <b>Figure 1.3: SCIRun NetworkEditor after building the Chapter 1 network.</b>
    </center>
    
   <p> <B>Modules</B>: A module is a single-purpose unit that functions within a
   dataflow environment. Modules have at least one input port
   for receiving data, located at the top of the module, or one output
   port for sending data, located at the bottom of the module (See
   <B>Figure 1.4</B>).</p>

<p>For a more complete description of modules, consult the <a
    HREF="../../Guide/usersguide/srug2_3.html"><i>User's
    Guide</i>, Section 2.3 "Modules and Networks."</a></p>

<p> All modules have an indicator that alerts the user to messages
    that exist in a module's log. Different colors represent different
    types of messages. Gray means no message, blue represents a
    Remark, yellow a Warning, and red an Error. To read messages, click the
    module's indicator button to open the log window.</p>
                                                              
    <A NAME="figure-1.4">

    </CENTER>
   
<p> <B>Pipes</B>: Data is transfered from one module to another using
    dataflow connections,commonly refered to as <B>Pipes</B>. Each
    dataflow pipe transfers a specific datatype in SCIRun, denoted by
    a unique color. Pipes run from the output <B>Port</B> of one
    module to the input <B>Port(s)</B> of one or more other modules.
    Ports of the same color correspond to the same datatype and can
    be connected. These colors are described in detail
    in the <a
    HREF="../../Guide/usersguide/srug5_1.html"><i>User's
    Guide</i>, Section 4.2, "Anatomy of a Module"</a>.</p>

<p> Two or more connected modules form a SCIRun network, or <i>net</i>.</p>

    <H2><A name="section-1">FieldReader Module</A></H2>

    <p> Now it is time to begin creating a SCIRun dataflow net.  First,
    create a FieldReader module, which will be used to load a
    SCIRun Field dataset from disk.

    <ul><li>Select SCIRun-&gt;DataIO-&gt;FieldReader from the menu bar,
    as shown in <b>Figure 1.5</b>.</ul>

    <center>
    <p><IMG WIDTH="452" HEIGHT="290" src="images/figures/FieldReaderMenu.gif"><br>
    <b>Figure 1.5: Module Creation Menu (FieldReader).</b></p>
    </center>

    The FieldReader module will appear on the NetEdit frame.  Now,
    set user interface parameters for this module, by 
    pressing the <B><I>UI</I></B> button on the module.  This brings
    up a standard file selection dialog (<b><A
    HREF="#figure-1.6">Figure 1.6</A></b>).  Select the 
    <B>utahtorso-lowres/utahtorso-lowres-voltage.tvd.fld</B> input
    file. (Note: This file can be found in the SCIRunData directory.
    This directory should have been downloaded and installed when
    SCIRun was installed.)  This dataset contains a low resolution
    tetrahedral mesh of a human torso.

    <p><img src="images/figures/FieldReaderGui.gif"><br>
    <b>Figure 1.6: Field Reader file selection GUI.</b></p>
    </center>

    Once the file has been selected, the following will occur:

    <UL>
      <LI> The file selection window disappears.</p>
      <LI> The module reads in the dataset (a SCIRun Field) and the progress bar turns green.</p> 
      <LI> The module icon displays a number that indicates the amount
	   of CPU time required to complete its execution (<b><A
	   HREF="#figure-1.4">Figure 1.4</A></b>).</p>
    </UL>

    <B>Brief Field Overview</B>
    <p>
    A Field contains a geometric mesh, and a collection of data values
    mapped on to the mesh. Data can be stored at the nodes, edges,
    faces, and/or cells of the mesh. In this case, a
    tetrahedral mesh with voltages defined at the nodes of the mesh
    has been selected.
    <p>
    The dimensionality of the mesh type determines the available storage
    locations. For example, a TriSurf mesh has nodes, edges, and
    planar faces, but not cells, which are assumed to be
    three-dimensional elements.  As a result, a TriSurf cannot store
    data in cells, but can store data in edges or faces.
    <p>
    See <A HREF="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</A> for a description
    of various types of geometric meshes, data values, and mappings
    SCIRun supports.
    
    <H2><A name="section-4">Hooking Modules Together</A></H2>
    
    Now add a second module to the network.  This module is 
    used to visualize various Field types. Then connect the
    two modules in the canvas so data can flow between them.</p>
   
     <OL>
        <LI value="1."> Create a ShowField module using the
             SCIRun-&gt;Visualization menu (use the same menus 
             used to create the FieldReader module).

        <LI> Position the mouse pointer over the yellow output port on

    <H2><A name="section-4.1">Dynamic Compilation</A></H2>

    <p>
    ShowField works with all SCIRun Field data types. However, these
    data types must first be compiled into a shared library (as
    needed) where they are saved for future use.  This process is
    called &quot;Dynamic Compilation.&quot;</p>
    <p>
    Dynamic Compilation causes a delay when the module
    executes the first time. For more details, refer to <a
    href="http://www.sci.utah.edu/publications/mcole01/dyn.pdf">"Dynamic
    Compilation."</a>

    <p>
    In addition, the module turns light yellow while it compiles, and
    compilation output goes to the module's log as a remark. Note that
    SGI computers can take over 30 seconds to perform dynamic
    compilation.  When compilation is done, the modules color 
    returns to a light gray.</p>

    <p><b>Setting the ShowField User Interface</b></p>
    
    <p>
    The ShowField module has options for changing the visual
    representations of a Field's geometry.  To illustrate the module's
    functionality, change ShowField parameters using
    its GUI.  Specifically, change the color of the nodes
    to blue spheres.
    <p>
    <OL>
      <LI value="1.">Select the UI button on the ShowField module.
      <BR><P>
      <LI> Select the Default Color button near the bottom of the GUI
           to change the default color and a separate Color Chooser GUI
           appears.
      <BR><P>
      <LI> In the Color Chooser GUI, use the sliders to adjust the color
           values. Set Red and Green to 0.00, and Blue to 1.00. The

      The ShowField module is ready to render the nodes as blue
      spheres. The module Interactively Updates, by default, to
      execute after every user GUI change. Users can select the
      <I>Execute button only</I> box to delay all changes until the
      <I>Execute</I> button is pressed. This is useful with large
      dataset,when rendering takes a long time.)  Consult the <a

     The Viewer is the last module that will be added to the
     network. (More information about the Viewer can be found in the <a

       Viewer input port. Notice the Viewer module automatically
       creates a new input port; this is an example of a SCIRun module
       that has dynamic input ports.  This allows the Viewer module to
       support an infinite number of geometry producing modules.
       <BR><P> <LI> Open the ViewWindow by pressing the Viewer's UI

       or translated), and you want the viewer to re-display
       everything in the center of the screen, use the Autoview
       button.)  At this point, the utah-torso voltage Field should
       appear in the Viewer window.  It should appear similar to

    Now review the controls at the bottom of the ViewWindow
    (see <b>Figure 1.13</b>). Buttons located at the bottom of the
    ViewWindow are used for the following functions:</p>
 
      <UL>
        <LI> Autoview: attempts to render all objects on the screen.
        <BR><P>
        <LI> Set Home View: captures the setting of the current view
             (position, scale, angle, etc.) so it can be returned to
             by clicking the "Go home" button.
        <BR><P>
        <LI> Go home: restores the current home view (set by the last
        press of the <I>Set Home View</I> button.)
        <BR><P>
        <LI> Views: allows the user to select from a list of standard
	  viewing angles and orientations.

    Now that a three-module network has been created, save the net to
    disk.  The net can  easily be reloaded in a future SCIRun
    session.

    <p>Saving a SCIRun network:</p>

      <p><ol><li value="1.">Click on the File menu (at the top of the
      Network Editor window) and select "Save As."</p>
      <p><li>When the file browser appears, follow the prompt to choose a
	  location and filename for the net. By convention, most
	  nets are stored in the SCIRun/src/nets/ directory, but can be stored in another location.</p>
      <p><li>For this example, store the net as
	  SCIRun/src/nets/show-torso-mesh.net, as in <b>Figure
	  1.15</b>. The .net suffix is used for SCIRun network files.</p>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Please note, to avoid losing work, it is strongly
          recommended that nets be saved frequently.</p></b> <br>

<p><ol><li>Click the Save button. The network is saved, and the dialog
      disappears.</p> <p><li>Exit SCIRun by selecting File-&gt;Quit from the NetworkEditor menu or pressing Ctrl-Q.</p></ol> <p>Loading a SCIRun
      network:</p> <p><ol><li>Start SCIRun.</p> <p><li>From the File
      drop-down menu, select the the Load... option.</p> <li>Select

    <b>Figure 1.16: GUI for loading a network.</b></p>

    <p>The net reloads into SCIRun, where it was previously saved. If
    the net was saved with any of the module UIs open, those UIs
    automatically re-open when loaded to the net.  After changing
    module settings (<i>e.g.</i>, rotating the image in the ViewWindow
    or changing the rendering color of the nodes in ShowField), there
    are two options for re-saving the net:</p>
   
      <p><ol><li>Overwrite existing show-torso-mesh.net file by
	  using File-&gt;Save from the drop-down menu.</p>  
      <p><li>Save the net to a new file by using File-&gt;Save As...</p>

    <p>Chapter 1 demonstrated the construction of a three module
    network to visualize the geometry of a mesh, and how to render
    that mesh to the viewing window.  This chapter also instructed the
    user on saving and reloading networks.

    <p>Chapter 2 features additional tools to examine data values, 
    and instructions for varying colors over the geometry.
