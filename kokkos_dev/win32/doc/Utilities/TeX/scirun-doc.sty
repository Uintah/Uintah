% Latex package to be used by scirun documents.  Markup commands exist
% in two files.  This one and scirun-doc.tex.  Scirun-doc.tex contains
% commands that are processed by both latex and by the builtin
% capabilities of latex2html.  This file contains commands that are
% completely ignored by latex2html or are processed by functions in
% the latex2html extension file scirun-doc.perl.
%
% Documents should include the
% following latex commands:
%
% \usepackage{scirun-doc}
% \input{scirun-doc.tex}
%

% Define \newmucmd --- ``new markup command''.  Use \newmucmd to
% define new markup commands.  \newmucmd takes 2 arguments.  The first
% is the name of the new markup command and the second is a command to
% stylize the markup command's content when processed by latex.  The
% new markup command takes one argument which is the markup command's
% content.   When processed by latex, content will be stylized
% according to the second argument given to \newmucmd.  When
% processed by latex2html, content will be a child of a <span> element
% and stylized by a css class named after the markup command.
\def\newmucmd#1#2{%
  \expandafter\def\csname #1\endcsname##1{%
