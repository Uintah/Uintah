      <p>SampleColorMap allows the user to select a point in the colormap to determine which color a value corresponds. This  module will work with a non-rescaled colormap, but will generally not be interesting unless the colormap is rescaled.  You can get a rescaled colormap from the RescaleColorMap, TextureVolVis or TexCuttingPlanes modules. </p>
