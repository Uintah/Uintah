    <summary>Isosurface allows visualization of an isopotential
     surface within a model. IsoSurface allows interactive extraction of isosurfaces in the voltage field.  
     </summary>
     <description>
      <p>A small sphere controls the starting point of the isosurface alogortihm, and an attached 3D arrow widget may be moved using the mouse, allowing interactive exploration of the voltage field.  Draggin on the arrow allows the the user to move the widget along the line defined by the gradient; dragging on the sphere allows unconstrianed movement of the seed point.</p>

<p>In the Isosurface module GUI, changing the Iso Value allows visualization of any isopotential surface. The Update options are: On Release, Manual and Auto.  On Release will not re-execute the module until the user releases the Iso Value scroll bar. If the user selects the Manual option, the module will not re-execute until they press the Extract button.  The Auto option re-executes the module every time the Iso Value scroll bar moves. If the user selects the Auto Extract from New Field option and a new Field comes in, the module completely re-executes, calculating a new Isosurface.  The Build TriSurfField check box allows the user to pass the generated Isosurface downstream. If the ColorMap does not pass in to the Isosurface module, the user can specify the Default Color. </p>
      <p>The Isosurface can be calculated using the Marching Cubes method (MC), which examines the isopotential at the
      corners of every cell.  For this method, the user can specify the number of Threads
     .</p>
      <p> The Noise method stores the minimum and maximum values of all cells into a
      table.
      </p>
      <p>The Isosurface module is used to visualize surfaces or lines
        of constant value within a scalar field.  The Iso Value slider in the GUI determines which value is used to generate the
        isopotential surface.  The Update options are: On Release,
        Manual and Auto.  On Release will not re-execute the
        module until the user releases the Iso Value scroll bar. If
        manual is selected, the module will not re-execute until the
	Extract button is pressed.  The Auto option re-executes the modul eevery time the Iso Value scroll bar moves. If the user selects the Auto Extract from New Field option and a new Field comes in, the
	module completely re-executes, calculating a new Isosurface.  The Build Output Field check box allows the user to pass the generated Isosurface downstream as a field. If there is no ColorMap passed in to the module, the user can specify the Default Color to
        use instead.</p>
      <p> The Isosurface can be calculated using the Marching Cubes
method, which examines the isopotential at the corners of every
element within the input field.  This operation is parallelizeable and allows the user to specify how many threads are used to do the
computation.  If only a few isovalues are to be examined then this is
a great choice.
      </p>
      <p>
	The NOISE method computes and stores a table containing all of the input field elements and their values.  Then when the isovalue is specified the surface can be extracted more quickly by looking in the table for the appropriate values.  This gives better interactive
performance at the cost of some setup time and space.  
      </p>
      <p>
        As of September 2002 this module can handle scalar fields of the following geometry type: LatVolField, StructHexVolField, TetVolField,HexVolField, TriSurfField, QuadSurfField and ImageField.
Isocontours are generated for the surface input fields, and
Isosurfaces are generated for the volume input fields.
