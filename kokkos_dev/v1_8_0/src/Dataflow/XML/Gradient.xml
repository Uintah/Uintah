    <summary>The Gradient module computes the derivative of a scalar field and converts it to a vector field. The gradient is the derivative of three dimensions; the first component in the X direction, the second component in the Y direction, and the third component in the Z direction grid, computing the general direction of "flow" at a specific point on the geometry. 
<p>At this time, LatVolMesh and tetVolMesh are the only SCIRun supported Fields accepted by the Gradient module. The Gradient module has no GUI. If Gradient recieves as input a Field type it does not support, an error message appears in the Error frame of the SCIRun environment.</p> </summary>
