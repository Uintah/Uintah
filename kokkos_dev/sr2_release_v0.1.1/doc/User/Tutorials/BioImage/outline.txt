---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction DARBY
	a. goal of BioImage (data inspection, pre-processing, visualization)
	b. explain tutorial will walk users through loading, pre-processing, and volume rendering a volume

2. Getting Started DARBY
	a. Preparations
		1. environment variables and sample data
		2. unlimit command 
	b. Launching BioImage

3. User Interface Organization (briefly touch on each) HARTNER
        a. menus 
        b. processing tab (see Reference Guide)
        c. rendering windows (see Reference Guide for more information on controls for the 2D and 3D viewers)
        d. Visualization Pane (see Reference Guide for more information on visualization techniques)

4. Loading Data    ERIK
	a. BioImage works on 3D regular data
	b. types of input files include Nrrd, Dicom, Analyze, Field (see Reference Guide for more information on loading these different kinds of datasets)
	c. introduce the tooth dataset and explain steps to load it 
	d. explain orientation cube, labels, and what they see in each window
        e. talk about Update button and eye (see Reference Guide for more options)         
  
	
5. Pre-processing Filters  ERIK
	a. explain motivation behind dynamic filters and maintaining a history
	b. walk through process of resampling tooth dataset (see Reference Guide for more pre-processing filters)

6. Visualization HARTNER
	a. Planes
	       1. change the slices
               2. change the colormap (see Reference Guide for more Planes visualizaiton options)
	
	b. Volume Rendering
	       1. turning on
	       2. explain the transfer function, what the points represent, and how to pull out basic features (see Reference Guide for more advanced explainations regarding editing the transfer function)

	c. Viewer Options
               1. rotating volume, zoom in/out, translate
