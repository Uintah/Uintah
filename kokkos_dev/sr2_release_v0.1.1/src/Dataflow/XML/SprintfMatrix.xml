    <summary>
      This module does a sprintf with input matrices into a new
string.
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p>This module module takes in a formatted string (a string with
%01d, %4.5f, %g etc) and takes the numbers of the input matrix and
puts these formatted numbers into the string. The input matrix can be
a scalar but can as well be a full dense matrix. The module takes each
number out of the matrix and puts it in the formatted number string.
For example in order to plot the contents of a 1 by 3 vector one may
choose a formatstring of '%f %f %f\n', which will put all three value
in the matrix in the formatted string. If there are more numbers in
the matrix then in the format string then the current format string
will be reused. Hence to get the contents of a 4 by 4 matrix in a
comma seperated list one can choose a format string of '%5.5f, '. This
will apply this format string to each number in the matrix. In case
multiple matrices are supplied, first all the values of the first
matrix will be used, then all the numbers of the next matrix etc. When
there are more positions in the matrix where one can fill out a number
then the rest will be padded with the value 0.0.</p>
      <p>>Note the formatstring may contain '%s', which will remain in
the format string and is not touched by this module. To insert strings
use SprintfString instead.</p>
