	HOW TO CREATE A COMPLEX GEOMETRY AND INCORPORATE IT IN UINTAH

	1- Log on to a CADE machine

	2- Open ProE:  proe2001

	3- Create the geometry or modify an existing geometry

	4- Once the geometry has been created, you will want to save it as a
	part and also as an igs.  To do this go to File->Save a Copy.  In Type,
	select prt and type in the name of your choice.  Then repeat, but in
	Type, select igs.

	5- Open Gambit:  gambit

	6- Go to File->Import->IGES and select the file, click Accept

	7- You can translate the geometry or move it, if needed 

	8- To mesh, click on the second button under Operation.  It is a yellow
	block.  Then click on the 3rd button under Mesh.  In the Faces bar,
	click on the arrow and select all of the faces.  Change the elements to
	Tri and change the Spacing.  I have been using 0.01.  Then click Apply.

	9- Go to File->Export->Mesh.  Type the name of your choice, but leave
	the extension .neu and click Accept.

	10- Copy the .neu file to your SCIrun directory.

	11- Run gambitFileReader.  It will ask you the name of the .neu file and
	then the name of the output. I usually use the same name.

	12- Copy the geometry pts and tri file the the same location as your
	input file.
	
	13- Add the geometry to your input file.
