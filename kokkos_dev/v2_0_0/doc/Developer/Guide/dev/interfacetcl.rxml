    <title>The SCIRun Interface to Tcl</title>
    
    
      <para>
      This chapter describes how to easily communicate between the GUI
      (Tcl/Tk) and the C++ elements of SCIRun modules.
    </para>
    

    <section>
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>
      SCIRun uses TCL/TK as its GUI font end. However, the TCL/TK
      was not designed with a clean interface between TCL code
      and C/C++. The purpose of this directory is to provide an abstraction
      layer between the two and make the task of moving data between the 
      TCL and the C++ portions of SCIRun transparent to the user.
    </para>

      <para>
      Most of the code in the Dataflow/GuiInterface directory is used
      internally in SCIRun.  
      The only exception are the GuiVars which can be access from both
      the tcl and the C++ codes. These variables provide a transparent
      mechanism in C++ to set or get the tcl variables they represent.
      Each such tcl variable is associated with a Module and thus contains
      information about the module tcl id and a pointer to the module. 
    </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Programming with the SCIRun GuiInterface</title>

      <para>
      On the TCL side, the code should access the variables as regular
      tcl variables. On the C++ side, the code needs to declare these
      variables inside a Module and access them via the get() and
      set() functions.  
    </para>

      <section>
	<title>GuiVar</title>
	<para>
      GuiVars are variables that encapsulate the interaction between
      the C++ code 
      and the GUI (Graphical User Interface) code. The variable does not
      hold the actual value, rather it holds information which is used
      to access the corresponding variable on the GUI side. From the C++
      side the user may set the variable value via a set() function and
      retrieve the value via a get() function.
    </para>

	<para>
      There are several specialization of GuiVar for particular variable types
      such as GuiInt, GuiString and GuiPoint.
    </para>

	<para>
      In a tcl code, i.e. in a tcl module:
    </para>

	<programlisting>
      itcl_class foo {
         ...
        method set_defaults {} {
	  global $this-min
	  global $this-max

	  set $this-min 0                 # set to 0
	  set $this-max [set $this-min]   # '[set $this-var]' returns its value
         }

         ...
       }
    </programlisting>
	<para>
       In the C++ side, i.e. in a module:
     </para>
	<programlisting>
       class Demo : public Module {
         ...
         GuiInt gui_min, gui_max;         // define GUI variables

	 Demo( const clString&amp; id );
	 void init();
       };

       Demo::Demo( const clString &amp;id ) 
         : Module(...), 
	   gui_min("min",id, this),       // initialize a variable with
	   gui_max("max",id,this)         // its name on the tcl side.
       {
	...
       }

       void Demo::init() 
       {
	  gui_min.set(7);               // set a tcl variable
	  int i = gui_max.get();        // get a value from the tcl side
       }
    </programlisting>
