  <title>Custom Tk Widgets for SCIRun</title>
 
  
    <para>
      This chapter describes extensions made to Tk by SCIRun to
      provide for custom widgets.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      The main purpose of this directory is provide additional GUI
      component that are needed by SCIRun but are not provided by
      Tk nor are easily implemented (if at all) in native TclTk. 
      These extensions include support for an OpenGL window, three 
      dimension look and feel and moving the cursor to a specified
      window. These extensions are implemented here in C++ and are
      added to the Tk built in commands in the initialization stage.

      <para>
	There are three components to this interface: Initialization,
	extensions and a hack of the Tk internals. GUI extensions to Tk
	should be implemented here and added to the Tk built in commands
	via the initialization in tkAppInit.c
      </para>

      <para>
	A special attention should be given to the tclUnixNotify-*.c 
	files. These files are a hack of a similar file internal to Tk.
	Their purpose is to enable Tk to work in a multithreaded 
	environment even though it was not designed to do so. Since the
	corresponding file in the Tk distribution changes between different
	versions of Tk we have included a modified version for the two
	versions of Tk that are supported by SCIRun, namely 8.0.4 and 8.3 .
      </para>

      <para>
        The code in this directory is meant to be used only via the tcl 
	commands that it provides. Any tcl code can call these commands
	to create the GUI they provide.
      </para>

     <section>
       <title>tk command</title>
    <para>
      Tk provides a set of builtin GUI commands. One can augment them
      by providing additional functions written in C++ (or C). These 
      additional functions can interface the TCL/TK system via C function
      calls as describe in the TCL/TK documentation.

     <section>
       <title>tkOpenGL</title>
    <para>
      A Tk window that embodies an OpenGL window.
