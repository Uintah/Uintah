<question>
<para>
Should <type>std::vector</type> or <type>SCIRun::Array1</type> be used?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
In cases where performance does not matter, use
<type>std::vector</type>.  However, in cases where optimal
performance is needed, compare the performance of
<type>std::vector</type> and <type>SCIRun::Array1</type>. In some cases, <type>SCIRun::Array1</type> is significantly
faster.

<question>
<para>
What is the granularity of modules?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
Modules that start at
one level sometimes divide or merge to a different level.
When designing and writing the code, it is important to
think in terms of modularity, even within a single module, so
subsequent divisions or reorganization is possible.  One approach is to
present the design for a new module or set
of modules to the group. Perhaps others are interested in some
part of the functionality, or can provide existing modules for the new
module.  This way, there is benefit from the collective plans and
knowledge of the group.

<para>
Are accounts needed for the CVS? How are the latest version of SCIRun or BioPSE checked out?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
At present, remote access to the code repository requires a
SCI account.  To get the most recent released version,
visit SCI's web site to download archives.  Users may place the resulting
files on their own code repository site and manage their own
development.

<question>
<para>
Are there guidelines for module testing? What is the testing
strategy?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
The nature of SCIRun as an interactive, user driven
program makes testing modules and their interactions 
challenging.  A user interface that
contains a state manager that accepts and manages input from all
user interface elements is being developed.  One advantage of such a manager is the replacement  of the interactive input with a program that
supplies a script of interaction requests. the state manager
can respond as if a user executed the requests manually.
Development of this structure is in progress.

<question>
<para>
What does XML have to do with SCIRun?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
Each module in BioPSE requires an XML-based  description of its
functionality.  The information in the XML module description provides
information to assist the <ulink
url=<!--%=doc.treeUrl("doc/Developer/Guide/create_module.html") %-->>
module-maker</ulink>, and helps create the template for a module.  The
XML module description also forms the
basis of a Reference Manual of all modules, and provides
information to SCIRun about the number of types of ports the
module needs when it appears in a network diagram.  The document
<citetitle><ulink url=<!--%=doc.treeUrl("doc/Documentum/module-xml/index.html") %-->>XML
Module Descriptions (Explicated)</ulink></citetitle> describes the
format and content of the XML file in detail.

<question>
<para>
What does it mean to <firstterm>validate</firstterm> a design
specification in XML?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
XML requires adherence to
the language standard, unlike HTML, that permits  implicit
actions such as environments that are never closed properly.   
Use a <ulink
url="http://mom.cvrti.utah.edu/~dustman/srvalidate.html">validation
tool</ulink> to ensure an XML module description file adheres to
BioPSE specifications.

Is this a coding error, or is this a
memory issue with the machine?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
There is nothing wrong with the machine, nor is it a coding error.
There is a conflict with IRIX and the SCIRun memory allocator that
has never been tracked down. It is a rare occurrence.

How does one customize the color of simple geometry objects such as cylinders?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
There are container classes for GeomObj's -- these are themselves
GeomObj's that contain one or more GeomObj's inside of them.
They are useful for building up scene graphs.  The
container used is a GeomMaterial -- its constructor
takes a GeomObj (e.g. a GeomCylinder) and a MaterialHandle.  (Note:
the constructor for a Material can be as simple as passing in a
Color triple!)

When creating a user data type, how does one specify a new
color to represent its port type in the module. 
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
When creating a new Port, add a file into Dataflow/Ports/.
The .cc file for the new Port type should have a specification for
a name and for a color.  See
<filename>SCIRun/src/Dataflow/Ports/MatrixPort.cc</filename> as an
example.

<para>
Why don't the settings in the modules GUI save when saving the network?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
GuiVars are needed. GuiVars enable the sharing of a variable between 
C++ and tcl, and are the only values that save to the tcl 
scripts.

Look at any module with a gui for an example (GuiString,
GuiInt,  GuiDouble, and in particular, look at their constructor).   
Synch with the tcl side by specifying the name of the var 
on the tcl side.  
</para>
<para>
On the C++ side:
<programlisting>
GuiInt myint_;

// Initialization in constructor --
myint_("myint", id, &hellip;)
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
One the tcl side:

<programlisting>
set $this-myint 1    # or whatever value you want
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
Look at ShowField.cc and .tcl for examples.

<para>When does a thread start running?</para>
</question>


<answer>
<para>A thread starts running immediately, unless Stopped or
NotActivated in the Thread constructor.  In that case, use
thread->resume() or thread->activate() (respectively) to start the thread running.  Stopped/thread->resume() is the preferred method.</para>
