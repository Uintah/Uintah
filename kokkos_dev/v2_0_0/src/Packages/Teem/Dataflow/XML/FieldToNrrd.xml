    <summary>Take the data from a field or fields and wrap it with a
nrrd and pass it out.

      <p>Inputs: a field or multiple fields that share the *same*
mesh. Output: a NrrdData.

      <p>
         This module converts data from a given field, into NrrdData.
NrrdData is the SCIRun object that is mostly a wrapper around a Nrrd*.
There are many operations that can be applied to the data as a nrrd,
<slink path="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gk/teem/unnrrdu/index.html"></slink>
many of which are supported in this Teem package. </p>
      <p>
        We store a handle to the Field that is input to this module in
the NrrdData, so that if it ever gets converted back to a Field, we
have a preffered target field type instead of one of the structured
defaults that NrrdToField will use if it cannot determine a prefferred
type. The User may want to use NrrdJoin to combine sets of data that
map to the same mesh into a single NrrdData. </p>

	<p>Run the test network (see examplesr tag), and verify that
geometry and data values are identical.  This can be done with visual
inspection. Just turn off and on display of nodes to compare
colors.</p>
