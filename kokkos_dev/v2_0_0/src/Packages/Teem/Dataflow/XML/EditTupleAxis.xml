    <summary>
      The EditTupleAxis module allows the user to edit the entries
of the tuple-axis associated with a Nrrd data set.
    </summary>
    <description>
	<p>The input Nrrd is copied with this module.  The output
string is checked to make sure that the number of entries match the
number of the input Nrrd.  For example, if the input Nrrd has a tuple
axis with the label "(Vector)", the output could be 
"(Scalar),(Scalar),(Scalar)", because the input data has three entries
along the tuple axis, as does the output.</p>
