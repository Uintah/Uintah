    <description>
      <p>Interface to introdued a NrrdData into the net. NrrdReader
can open a raw nrrd, or a previously saved SCIRun wrapped nrrd
(NrrdData). The user needs to verify the tuple axis, by selecting an
existing axis, or choosing to add a tuple axis.  The tuple axis, is
the axis along which related but disjoint data sets can be stored, for
example a pressure data set and a tempurature data set can be stored
in the same nrrd, by joining them along the tuple axis.  All nrrds
that pass through SCIRun must have a tuple axis.  Vector and Tensor
data sets store thier elements along the tuple axis, for example a 3
dimensional vector field is stored as a 4 dimensional nrrd, with x,y,z
components encoded in the Vector label along the tuple axis. </p>
      <p>
When the user specifies the nrrd to load, all of its axis info is
shown in the UI, where the user can select an axis to adopt as the
tuple axis, add tuple axis can be chosen.</p>
