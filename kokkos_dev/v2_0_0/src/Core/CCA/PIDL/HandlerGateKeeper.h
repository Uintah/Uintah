DESCRIPTION
   The HandlerGateKeeper class is associated with a server
   and it's purpose is to make collective component invocations
   be serviced one-by-one. The parallel component's processes
   can make several invocations to a callee parallel components.
   This class differentiates between calls of one parallel component
   and another.
