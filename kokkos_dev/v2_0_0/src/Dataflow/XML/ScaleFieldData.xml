    <summary>Scale the data values in a field.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        Scale the data values in a field by the values in the input
        matrix.  Only the first column of the input matrix is used to
        do the scale.  If there are not enough values in the input
        matrix, they are repeated as necessary.  For instance, a
        Column matrix containing 2 and 3 would scale half the values
        in a large field by 2, and the other half by 3.  Generally the
        ManageFieldData module would be used to extract a matrix from
        one field to be multiplied by another field.  Any type of
        input field is accepted.
