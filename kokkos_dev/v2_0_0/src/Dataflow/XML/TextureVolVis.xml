    <summary>This module implements a volume renderer using 3D texture
    hardware.

      <p>
        The Rendering Style Frame allows the selection of standard
        (Over Operator), maximum intensity projection (MIP) or
        attenuated (Attenuate) rendering styles.
     </p>
      <p> For large data, the View Mode, allows the user view the data
        at full resolution, or to see the maximum resolution along a
        line of sight or in a region of influence.  The line of sight
        and region of influence modes are controlled by a selection
        widget in the view window.
     </p>
      <p> The Interpolation Mode specifies linear interpolation
      (Interpolate) or nearest neighbor interpolation (Nearest).
        
     </p>
      <p> The slice transparency slider allows the user to control the
      slice transparency in concert with the transparency specified in the
      transfer function that was  provided to the GLTextureBuilder.  The range
      is from -1 (full transparency for each slice) to 0 (accept
      the values in the transfer function) to 1 (full opacity for each
      slice--except for regions that are zero in the transfer function)
     </p>
      <p> The number of slices slider controls rendering
      quality. Increase the number of slices to improve rendering
      quality. Decrease the number of slice to improve interaction.
