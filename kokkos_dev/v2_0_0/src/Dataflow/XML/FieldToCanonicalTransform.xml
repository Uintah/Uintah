      <p>Generate a trasformation matrix that transforms a 0 to 1 space box at the origin to the input Field's bounding box.  It is output in the Matrix output port.  Some Fields have transformations stored with them, some just have bounding box information, so the canonical transform may not include rotation information.</p>
