    <summary>The PathReader module reads a persistent camera path from a file.</summary>
    <description><p>Upon opening, the The PathReader GUI defaults to the directory that the user sets for their SCIRUN_DATA environment variable.  Otherwise, the GUI will default to the directory where the user's SCIRun executable resides. The current directory defaults to only show files with an .path extension which helps the user determine the difference between Paths and other files.  However, the PathReader can read-in a file with any extension so long as the data has the correct format.  If the user attempts to read-in a file that is other than a Path, or uses an incorrect file format, an error message appears in the Error frame within the SCIRun enrvironment. Clicking the OK button will load the file and dismiss the GUI.</p>
