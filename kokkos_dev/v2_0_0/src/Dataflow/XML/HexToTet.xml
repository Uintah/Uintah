    <summary>Convert a HexVolField into a TetVolField.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        Given a Hex field (or anything that supports the same interface)
	as input, produce a TetVol as output -- each Hex element gets
        split into 5 Tets.  In order to produce consistent splits across
        faces, we alternate between two different templates for how to do
        the split.  Currently HexVolMesh, StructHexVolMesh, and
        LatVolMesh fields can be converted into TetVolMeshes.
