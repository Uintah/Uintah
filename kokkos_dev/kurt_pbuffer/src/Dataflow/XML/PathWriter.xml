    <summary>The PathWriter module saves persistent representation of a path to a file.</summary>
    <description><p>Upon opening, the PathWriter GUI defaults to the directory that the user sets for their SCIRUN_DATA environment variable.   Otherwise, the GUI will default to the directory where the user's SCIRun executable resides. The user can enter the name of a file that the path saves to. The file should have a .path extension. The default file name is MyCameraPath.  The user may also choose between a Binary or ASCII file format.</p>
