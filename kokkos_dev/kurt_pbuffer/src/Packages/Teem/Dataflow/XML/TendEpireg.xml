    <summary>Register diffusion-weighted echo-planar images.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>Register diffusion-weighted echo-planar images. This
registration corrects the shear, scale, and translate along the phase encoding
direction (assumed to be the Y (second) axis of the image) caused by eddy
currents from the diffusion-encoding gradients with echo-planar imaging. The
method is based on calculating moments of segmented images, where the
segmentation is a simple procedure based on blurring (optional), thresholding
and connected component analysis. The registered DWIs are resampled with the
chosen kernel, with the seperate DWIs stacked along axis 0.</p>
      <p>List of Gradients : List of gradients, one gradient per line.</p>
      <p>Reference :which of the DW volumes (zero-based numbering) should be
      used as the standard, to which all other images are
      transformed. Using -1 means that 9
      intrinsic parameters governing the relationship between
      the gradient direction and the resulting distortion are
      estimated and fitted, ensuring good registration with the
      non-diffusion-weighted T2 image (which is never
      explicitly used in registration). Otherwise, by picking a
      specific DWI, no distortion parameter estimation is done.
      This value should be an integer.</p>
      <p>Blur X :standard devs in X direction of gaussian filter
      used to blur the DWIs prior to doing segmentation. This
      blurring does not effect the final resampling of
      registered DWIs. Use 0.0  to indicate no blurring
      This value should be a float.</p>
      <p>Blur Y :standard devs in Y direction of gaussian filter
      used to blur the DWIs prior to doing segmentation. This
      blurring does not effect the final resampling of
      registered DWIs. Use 0.0  to indicate no blurring
      This value should be a float.</p>
      <p>Threshold : Threshold value to use on DWIs, to do initial seperation
      of brain and non-brain. If the Use Default Threshold checkbox is checked, 
      the threshold is determined automatically by histogram analysis. </p>
      <p>CC Analysis : Use connected component analysis, after thresholding and
      before moment calculation.  Doing connected components analysis usually
      gives better results because it converts the thresholding output into
      something much closer to a real segmentation.</p>
      <p>Fitting : Only meaningful when the Reference equals -1. hen doing linear fitting
      of the intrinsic distortion parameters, it is good to
      ignore the slices for which the segmentation was poor. A
      heuristic is used to rank the slices according to
      segmentation quality. This option controls how many of
      the (best) slices contribute to the fitting. Use 0 to
      disable distortion parameter fitting. This value should be a flot.</p>
      <p>Kernel : kernel for resampling DWIs along the phase-encoding
      direction during final registration stage.</p>
      <p>Sigma : sigma used when kernel is gaussian.</p>
      <p>Extent : extent used when kernel is gaussian.</p>
