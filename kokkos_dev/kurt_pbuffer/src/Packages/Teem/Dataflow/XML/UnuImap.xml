    <summary>Map nrrd through *irregular* univariate map (colormap). A map is
irregular if the control points are not evenly spaced along the domain, and
hence their position must be explicitly represented in the map. As nrrds,
these maps are necessarily 2D. Along axis 0, the first value is the location
of the control point, and the remaining values give are the range of the map
for that control point. The output value(s) is the result of linearly
interpolating between value(s) from the map.</summary>

    <p>Map nrrd through *irregular* univariate map (colormap). A map is
irregular if the control points are not evenly spaced along the domain, and
hence their position must be explicitly represented in the map. As nrrds,
these maps are necessarily 2D. Along axis 0, the first value is the location
of the control point, and the remaining values give are the range of the map
for that control point. The output value(s) is the result of linearly
interpolating between value(s) from the map.</p>
    <p>Length of accelerator array: length of accelerator array, 
    used to try to speed-up task of
    finding between which pair of control points a given value
    lies. Not terribly useful for small maps (about 10 points or
    less). Use 0 to turn accelorator off. This should be an integer.</p>
    <p>Rescale to the Map Domain : indicates whether to rescale the 
     input values from the input range to the map domain.</p>
    <p>Min : Only used when rescaling to the Map Domain. Indicates the low 
    end of input range. Should be a double.  To disregard
    this value and use the lowest value of the input nrrd, check Use
    lowest value of input nrrd as min.</p>
    <p>Max : Only used when rescaling to the Map Domain. Indicates the high 
    end of input range. Should be a double. To 
    disregard this value and use the highest value of the input nrrd, check Use
    highest value of input nrrd as max.</p>
    <p>Type: Specify the type of the output nrrd.  If Use map's type as
    output type is checked, this value will be disregarded and the map
    type will be used.</p>
