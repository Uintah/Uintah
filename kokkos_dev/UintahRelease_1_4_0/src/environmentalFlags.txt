ExecTimes         SCI_DEBUG     outputs the time for execution on each task.
ReductionTasks    SCI_DEBUG     outputs a message on processor 0 whenever a reduction task occurs.
RELOCATE_DBG      SCI_DEBUG     prints out debugging information in the code that finds the neighboring
                                patches inside of particle relocation task.
AMR               SCI_DEBUG     prints out the patch layout
TaskDBG           SCI_DEBUG     output the name of each task as it begins executing and when it's completed
TaskLevel         SCI_DEBUG     output the task name and beginning patch on each level after the 
                                task has completed.
TaskGraph         SCI_DEBUG     prints out computes and requires for every task
TaskGraphDetailed SCI_DEBUG     prints out internal details of computes and requires for every task
WaitForDebugger   SCI_DEBUG     when an exception is thrown halt the program and print out
                                the pid so you can attach a debugger to it.
OnDemandDataWarehouse           outputs when a variable is retrieved or put into the data warehouse.
