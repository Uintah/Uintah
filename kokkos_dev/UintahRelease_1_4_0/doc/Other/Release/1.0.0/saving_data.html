<h1> Saving Data </h1>

To have your simulation save data, or produce restartable "checkpoints", you can add a DataArchiver section to your input file.

<h2> Specifying an interval </h2>

If an interval is specified, it will write data after the first
timestep and then after a time specified by the interval.  There are
three interval types, and only one may be chosen for either output or
checkpoint:

<ul>
   <li> time interval - how much simulation time (in seconds) must pass before saving data </li>
   <li> timestep interval - how many timesteps must pass before saving data </li>
   <li> walltime interval - how much real time (in seconds) must pass
   before saving data.  Only available for checkpoints.  With a
   walltimeInterval, you may optionally specify the first walltime you
   wish to checkpoint.  This feature is useful if you know your
   simulation will only be able to run for so many hours.</li>
</ul>

Setting an interval to 0 will turn it off, whether it be output or checkpoint.

<h2> Output format </h2>

Output is saved in a directory called an "uda" (Uintah Data Archive).
When you run a simulation and have nonzero output intervals, sus will
save an uda directory with the name given in the input file (see input
parameters below), and append a 3-digit suffix specifying the order of
simulation, starting with 000.

In the uda directory, there is a index.xml file, a input.xml file, and
a timestep directory for each timestep sus saved data, specified as
t#####, where ##### is the number of the timestep.  If there are
checkpoints, there will be a checkpoints directory as well, which will
also have an index.xml and a set of timestep diectories.

<h2> Checkpoints </h2>

Checkpoints are saved with an interval also, but the two main differences between checkpoints and normal outputs are:

<ul>
  <li> For a checkpoint, the simulation will determine which output is
  necessary to save, and for normal outputs you must specify which
  variables to save. </li>

  <li> The uda won't keep around all checkpoints it creates, it only
  keep the most recent few, based on the value of "cycle".  You might
  want to have more than 1 for cycle, in case there is a problem when
  saving the checkpoints. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Input parameters </h2>

These are the basic input fields for DataArchiver (as an actual example):
<pre>
  &lt;DataArchiver>
    &lt;filebase> simulation_10.uda &lt;/filebase>
    &lt;outputInterval> 0.01 &lt;/outputInterval>
    &lt;outputTimestepInterval> 50 &lt;/outputTimestepInterval>
    &lt;save label="press_CC"/>
    &lt;save label="temp_CC"/>
    &lt;checkpoint interval="0.05" cycle="2"/>
  &lt;/DataArchiver>
</pre>

  
<ul>
  <li> filebase is the name of the directory that will store the
  outputted data.  It is conventional to have the name reflect the
  simulation.  When the simulation is run the first time, a .000
  suffix will be appended (i.e., simulation_10.uda.000), and on each
  successive run, restart or otherwise, the suffix number will be
  incremented.  Inside the uda directory, there is one directory for
  every timestep that has been saved.</li>

  <li> outputInterval is the interval of simulation time that must pass before outputting data. </li>

  <li> outputTimestepInterval is similar to outputInterval, except
  that it is the number of timesteps that must pass before outputting.
  Note: this is mutually exclusive with outputInterval. </li>

  <li> save fields store the names of variables that are to be saved,
  one for each variable, with the name specified by the label
  attribute. </li>

  <li> checkpoint specifies that you will (potentially) want to
  restart the simulation.  See the section [[Restarting a
  simulation]].  The DataArchiver will save all the data necessary to
  resume a simulation in the checkpoints directory of the uda. </li>
</ul>

The frequency of the restartable information depends on the existence
of the interval, timestepInterval, or walltimeInterval attribute. You
may optionally specify the walltimeStart attribute
(e.g. walltimeStart="3600").  The cycle attribute determines how many
checkpoint folders to keep around before it starts removing them.

Examples of the other checkpoint attributes:
<pre>
   &lt;checkpoint timestepInterval="50" cycle="4"/>
   &lt;checkpoint walltimeInterval="3600" cycle="2"/>
   &lt;checkpoint walltimeInterval="3600" walltimeStart="37800" cycle="2"/>
</pre>

Other fields are:

<pre>
  &lt;DataArchiver>
    &lt;compression>rle, gzip&lt;/compression>
    &lt;outputDoubleAsFloat/>
    &lt;outputInitTimestep/>
    &lt;!-- save fields, filebase field, and checkpoint field as specified above -->
  &lt;/DataArchiver>
</pre>

<ul>
  <li> compression is the method in which to compress the data.  The
  compression types are "rle" (run-length encoding) and "gzip".  You
  may also choose a combination of these, such as "rle, gzip", which
  in essence means "try rle first and then gzip", or "gzip, rle", or
  "tryall", which tells it to try and means and see which one is the
  best.  The default is no compression. </li>

  <li> outputDoubleAsFloat tells the DataArchiver to store the output
  files in float format instead of double, potentially reducing the
  size of output files by 50% </li>

  <li> outputInitTimestep tells the DataArchiver to write data for the
  initialization timestep, or timestep 0.</li>
</ul>

You may also control which materials and which levels to save a variable.  By default, it will save all materials the variable is computed on, and on all levels.  To do otherwise, you may specify:

<pre>
   &lt;save label="temp_CC" matls="3,4" levels="1,2"/>
   &lt;save label="p.x" matls="0,1,2" levels="-1"/>
   &lt;save label="press_CC" matls="0" levels="0"/>
</pre>

Where a comma-separated list will specify the levels or materials.  A level of -1 specifies the "finest" level.
