KEYWORDS
   Colormap, Transfer Function

DESCRIPTION
     This module is used to create some
     "standard" non-editable colormaps in Dataflow/Uintah.
     Non-editable simply means that the colors cannot be
     interactively manipulated.  The Module does, allow
     for the the resolution of the colormaps to be changed.
     This class sets up the data structures for Colormaps and
     creates a module from which the user can choose from several
     popular colormaps.  By clicking in the Color band the user 
     manipulate the transparency of the color.  This is useful,
     for example, when volume rendering, though many visualization
     tool ignore the transparency data.
