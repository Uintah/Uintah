<h1>VIEWGRID</h1>

<b>Description:</b><p>

Displays the grid points for rectilinear and curvilinear grids.
<p>

Grid points can be represented by points or spheres.  Points are faster
but have poor visibility on small grids.  Spheres are much slower,
especially for large grids.<p>

The module takes a colormap as input, which it uses to color points
based on their x-coordinate.  When using this module in conjunction
with, for example, an isosurface module, this coloring helps the
user discriminate between axes.<p>

For rectilinear grids, only the number of grid points in each direction
is required as further input.  Curvilinear grids are more complex.
First, a geometry file is required, since the locations of the points
must be specified explicitly (this is the same file used by the
<a href="bonocl.html">BONOCL</a> and <a href="tboncl.html">TBONCL</a>
modules).  Other inputs include the number of zones in the geometry
and the number of points in each dimension for each zone.  Each zone's
visibility can be toggled on or off with checkboxes in the GUI.  The
module can currently display 0 - 4 zones.<p>
