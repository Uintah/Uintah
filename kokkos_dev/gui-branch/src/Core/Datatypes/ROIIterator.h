DESCRIPTION
   Region Of Influence Iterator  class.  If we have a multiresolution texture,
   we may only want to resolve it in a certain region.  This iterator will
   step through the Bricks and return those in that region at full
   resolution.  Textures further away from the region will get
   rendered at lower resolution.
