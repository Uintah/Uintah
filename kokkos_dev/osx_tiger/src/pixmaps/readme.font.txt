LARABIE FONTS FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

    * Q: How do use these fonts in my favourite software?
    * A: In Windows, you take the fonts out of the ZIP archive and place them in your fonts folder which can be found in your Control Panel. The next time you run your software, the font will be available. For example: If you install a new font, the next time you run Microsoft Word, that font will be available in the menu under Format / Font. For anything more complicated, or Mac installation, visit www.larabiefonts.com/help.html

    * Q: How can I use this font in AOL Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Outlook, Outlook Express, Euodora or any other email software?
    * A: At the time of this writing (Feb 2004) you can$(B!G(Bt. After installing one of my fonts, you may be able to select it in the above applications but the person at the other end won$(B!G(Bt see that same thing unless they have the font installed. If you really want to use my fonts in these applications, make sure the people at the other end have the same fonts installed.

    * Q: How can I use these fonts on a web page?
    * A: If you$(B!G(Bre creating a web page using Flash, it$(B!G(Bs easy. Consult your Flash manual. If you$(B!G(Bre using Acrobat, make sure the font embedding settings are turned on. Consult your Acrobat manual. For anything else there are limitations: If you want to use one of my fonts as your main, text font you$(B!G(Bre pretty much out of luck unless you explore a font embedding tool such as WEFT but I don$(B!G(Bt recommend it. To use my fonts as headings or titles, use image creation software such as The Gimp, Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, Pixia etc. Save the images as GIF files and place them on your web page. There$(B!G(Bs a lot more to it than can be explained here but there are countless books available on web page design.

    * Q: How can I make these fonts bigger?
    * A: All my fonts are infinitely scalable; the limitations are in your software. A common problem is scaling fonts in Microsoft Word. If you choose Format / Font you can type in any number you like under $(B!H(Bsize$(B!I(B.

    * Q: Are these fonts really free?
    * A: Yes they are. Some fonts such as Neuropol have expanded font families available for sale at www.typodermic.com but the version you downloaded at Larabie Fonts is free.

    * Q: Your licence agreement states that the fonts can$(B!G(Bt be altered. Does that mean I can$(B!G(Bt mess around with your fonts in Photoshop/Illustrator/Publisher etc?
    * A: Those license restrictions refer to altering the actual fonts themselves, not what you make with them. As long as you don$(B!G(Bt alter the font files in font creation software such as FontLab or Fontographer you$(B!G(Bre free to create anything you like with them.

    * Q: Can I use your fonts in a logo?
    * A: Yes. But check with a lawyer if you$(B!G(Bre not sure. It$(B!G(Bs okay with me if you use it but do so at your own risk.

    * Q: Can I send you a sample of the nifty thing I created with your fonts?
    * A: Of course. Check www.larabiefonts.com/donation.html for my current email or mailing address.

    * Q: Can you make a custom font for me?
    * A: Possibly. Check typodermic.com/custom.html for details. Keep in mind that making fonts is my full-time job so no freebies.

    * Q: I want to sell software that includes you font files.
    * A: Contact me first at www.larabiefonts.com/email.html.

    * Q: I want to sell rubber stamp alphabets, alphabet punches or stencil alphabets using your font designs.
    * A: Contact me first at www.larabiefonts.com/email.html.

    * Q: My software won$(B!G(Bt let me embed one of your fonts.
    * A: You may have an old version of one of my fonts. Uninstall it and install a current version on Larabie Fonts.

    * Q: Can you help me find a font?
    * A: I really don$(B!G(Bt have the time but if you send a donation, I can give it a try. If not. post your question on my font forum: www.larabiefonts.com/info.html.
