        ChangeFieldDataType allows the user to change the datatype
        at each field data_at location.  This module also attempts to convert the
        data in the field to the new type, if possible.  If no
        conversion is possible, the output field will contain default
        zero values.  Note that conversion from a large datatype to a
        smaller datatype usually results in a loss of precision.

          of mesh (TetVolField, LatVolField, TriSurfField, etc.) as well as the
          type of the data (unsigned char, double, Vector, Tensor, etc.).

<title>ChangeFieldDataType Regression Test</title>

<p>Here we convert the input from a field of doubles to a field of short
integers.  Because the original field ranges from around -6.0 to 5.0,
we first scale the data values such that they fall between 0 and 255.
Otherwise the output field would be mostly truncated to integers
between -6 and 4.</p>

<p>Note that the scale and data type change could be handled by the
TransformData module by selecting 'Short' as the output type and using
a function that first converted the data values to the desired range.</p>

<p>See also <modref package="SCIRun" name="TransformData"/>, <modref package="SCIRun" name="TransformData2"/>, <modref package="SCIRun" name="TransformData3"/>.</p>
