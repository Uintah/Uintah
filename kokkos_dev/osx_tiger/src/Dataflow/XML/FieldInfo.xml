        FieldInfo is purely an informational Module.  It performs no
	modification on input data.  Upon execution it displays
	attributes about the input field in the UI.
      </p>
      <p>
	Field Attributes displayed:
      </p>
      <p>
	Name - The Field name. May be blank.
      </p>
      <p>
	Generation - The Field internal object id.
      </p>
      <p>
	Typename - The C++ typename of the input Field Type.
      </p>
      <p>
	Center - The X,Y,Z coordinates of the average center of the
	nodes in the Field.
      </p>
      <p>
	Size - The X,Y,Z coordinates of the grid-aligned bounding box
	that encloses the Field.
      </p>
      <p>
	Data min,max - Only valid for scalar type input fields. Prints
	the respective min and max scalar values of the data
	associated with the input field.
      </p>
      <p>	
	# Nodes - The number of X,Y,Z points in the input field.
      </p>
      <p>
	# Elements - The number of highest dimension elements in the
        input field.  Ex.  For a PointCloudField this would equal
        the number of nodes.  For a TetVolField this would equal the
        number of tetrahedral cells in the input field.
      </p>
      <p>
	Data at - The location of the data values associated with the
	input field.
      </p>

        The input field attributes describe the field on the input
        port.  The Field Name, Typename, Bounding Box Min, Bounding Box Max, Data Min, Data Max, # of Nodes, # of Elements, and the Data At location.
