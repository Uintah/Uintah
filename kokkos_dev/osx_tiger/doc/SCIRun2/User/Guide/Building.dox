\page building Instructions for Configuring and Building the SCIRun2 Framework and Components
\section Overview

This document describes the process of configuring and building the SCIRun2
research code, including the SCIRun2 framework, GUI, and various
experimental component models.

\section building1 SCIRun2 is not SCIRun

SCIRun2 is not
<a href="http://software.sci.utah.edu/scirun-biopse_1_20.html">SCIRun</a>.
SCIRun2, however, does currently have dependencies on many of the original
SCIRun components and classes.
Because of these dependencies (and for other historical reasons) building
SCIRun2 also requires building SCIRun.
Eventually, the original SCIRun dataflow classes will be isolated from
SCIRun2 and built only as an optional component.

\section building2 For the impatient
<a href = "nightly.sh.txt">This script</a>
may tell you all you need to know.

\section building3 Supported platform(s)
SCIRun2 code has never been built on anything other than Redhat
Linux.
In theory, it should be possible to configure SCIRun2 on any
Unix-like platform.

\section building4 Configuring SCIRun2
As described above, SCIRun2 software must be built along with SCIRun.
To build the SCIRun2 framework, add the --enable-scirun2 option to the
SCIRun configure line.
Dependencies for SCIRun2 components are configured by adding necessary
--with-foo options.

The following command line, for example, configures SCIRun2 with the
works.
Also see
<a href = "nightly.sh.txt">this script</a>.

\code
PATH/TO/SCIRun/src/configure  --enable-scirun2 
                                --enable-debug 
                                --enable-package="" 
                                --with-thirdparty=$THIRDPARTY 
                                --with-babel=$BABELDIR 
                                --with-mpi=$MPIDIR 
                                --with-ruby=$RUBYDIR 
                                --with-vtk=$VTKDIR 
                                --with-qt=$QTDIR
\endcode

You may want to start with a strong cup of coffee.

\section building5 Dependencies
SCIRun2 code has dependencies on multiple third-party software packages.
The table below lists the various code modules available with SCIRun2 and
their dependencies.

\subsection building5_1 SCIRun    
SCIRun2 software is distributed with SCIRun.
Any necessary SCIRun classes build automatically.

\subsection building5_2 SCIRunThirdparty
This package consists of all the bundled third-party libraries for SCIRun.
It is freely available
<a href="http://software.sci.utah.edu/scirun-biopse_1_20.html">here</a>.
Look for the tarball called "Thirdparty_install.1.22.0.tar.gz".

Estimated time to build: 1 hour

Before building SCIRun2, set the following environment variables:
\code 
SCIRUN_THIRDPARTY=/path/to/scirun/thirdparty/installation
PATH=$SCIRUN_THIRDPARTY/bin:$PATH</code>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SCIRUN_THIRDPARTY/lib:$LD_LIBARARY_PATH
\endcode

\subsection building5_3 Qt
Qt is necessary if you want to build the graphical user interface to the
SCIRun2 framework (recommended).
A free version of Qt for noncommercial use can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.trolltech.com">www.trolltech.com</a>.
The distributions "qt-x11-free-3.3.x" have been tested.
<em>Be sure to configure and build Qt with multithreading enabled
(<b>Qt configure option -thread</b>).</em>

Estimated time to build: 3-5 hours

Before building SCIRun2, set the following environment variables:
\code
QTDIR=/path/to/qt/installation
PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
\endcode

\subsection building5_4 Ruby
Ruby is an interpreter for the Ruby scripting language.
Ruby can be freely downloaded from
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">www.ruby-lang.org</a>.

Estimated time to build: 1 hour

Before building SCIRun2, set the following environment variables:
\code
RUBYDIR=/path/to/ruby/installation
PATH=$RUBYDIR/bin:$PATH
\endcode

\subsection building5_5 Babel
The Babel compiler can be freely obtained from
<a href="http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components/babel.html">
www.llnl.gov/CASC/components/babel.html</a>.
SCIRun2 currently supports Babel version 0.9.0 and 0.9.2.

Estimated time to build: < 1 hour

Before building SCIRun2, set the following environment
variables:
\code
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/install
BABEL_HOME=/path/to/babel/install
PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$BABEL_HOME/bin:$PATH
\endcode
        
\subsubsection building5_5_1 Babel 0.9.0

\em IMPORTANT! The standard distribution of Babel version 0.9.0 requires
<a href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=libxml2">
libxml2 2.6.2</a>.
If you have at least libxml2 2.4.0, however, then you can apply
<a href="http://www.sci.utah.edu/~ayla/cca/babel_090_libxml2_patch.txt">
this patch</a>
to your Babel source tree instead of upgrading libxml.
The patch should be applied to the Babel <b>SOURCE</b> tree before building
Babel.
If you have already built Babel, then you will need to remove the current
Babel installation, untar a clean source tree, apply the patch, then
rebuild and install Babel.

\code
% cd babel-0.9.0
% patch -p1 < babel_090_libxml2_patch.txt
\endcode

See
<a href="https://www.cca-forum.org/bugs/babel/issue26.">this page</a>
for further details.

\subsubsection building5_5_2 Babel 0.9.2

The standard distribution of Babel version 0.9.2 requires at least
libxml2 2.4.0.

\subsection building5_6 VTK 
The Visualization Toolkit can be freely downloaded from
<a href="http://www.vtk.org">www.vtk.org</a>.
SCIRun2 VTK components have been tested with VTK 4.2.

Estimated time to build: 2-3 hours

\subsection building5_7 MPI
The SCIRun2 software has only been tested with the Lam-MPI implementation.
The Lam-MPI software can be freely downloaded from
<a href="http://www.lam-mpi.org">www.lam-mpi.org</a>.
SCIRun2 will \em not build correctly with MPICH.

Estimated time to build: 2-3 hours

\section building6 Nightly build

SCIRun2 software is built from the current CVS repository each night.
You can see the results of the nightly build \ref nightly "here".

\section building8 Running SCIRun2
Now that you have successfully build the software, see
\ref running "this page"
to learn how to run the software.
