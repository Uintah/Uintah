# Configuration file for the publish.rb script.
#
# This file is really a Ruby Hash using Ruby hash syntax:
#   <key> => <value>
# where <key> is a string and <value> is <key>'s associated value.
# The type of <value> is commonly a string although Ruby boolean, IO,
# and Array type values occur as well.  In one instance a sub-type of Hash
# is used (the Dest type).
#

# Select group to publish.
# Must be one of "SCIRun", "BioPSE", or "Uintah"
# Default: "BioPSE"
"group" => "BioPSE",

# Location of the scirun tree
# Default: "."
"buildDir" => ".",

# The name of the tree to publish.  
# Defaults to "SCIRunDocs" if missing.

#  "user": User name on remove machine.  May be empty if delivering
#          locally.
#          Default: ""  
#  "mach": Ip address of remote machine or "." for local delivery.
#          Default: "."
