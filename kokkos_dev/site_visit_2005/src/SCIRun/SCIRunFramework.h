/**
 * \class SCIRunFramework
 * 
 * \brief An implementation of the CCA AbstractFramework for SCIRun2.
 *
 * The SCIRunFramework is a wrapper around a set of services for creating and
 * connecting components (the underlying framework).  Most interaction with the
 * underlying framework is actually done through the BuilderService port, but the
 * BuilderService relies on some of the methods and ivars implemented
 * in this class.  BuilderService is obtained through a CCA Services object,
 * which is the standard link between a CCA component and its framework.
 * A Services object is retrieved via SCIRunFramework::getServices.
 *
 * The BuilderService class is a standard CCA object responsible for
 * instantiating and connecting components.  In order to do this, it relies on
 * much of the functionality implemented in the SCIRunFramework class and in
 * the various ComponentModel classes contained in the SCIRunFramework.
 *
 * The SCIRunFramework maintains a list of ComponentModels that have
 * information about components available for instantiaion and use in the
 * framework.  ComponentModels are of various types (CCA, Vtk, Bridge, etc.)
 * but all have a standard API that the SCIRunFramework (acting as proxy for the
 * BuilderService) uses to instantiate components registered in that component
 * model.
 *
 * 
 * \sa BuilderService AbstractFramework 
 * \todo createTypeMap is not fully implemented
 * \todo releaseServices is not fully implemented
 * \todo shutdownFramework is not fully implemented
 * \todo implement shutdownComponent?
 * \todo createEmptyFramework is not fully implemented
 * \todo register a creation event for component (in registerComponent)  */

  /** Standard CCA::AbstractFramework method that creates and returns an empty
      CCA Map object appropriate for use in an ensuing call to getServices. */
  virtual sci::cca::TypeMap::pointer createTypeMap();

  /** Returns a handle to the services provided by this framework (getting and
      releasing ports, registering ports, querying port properties, etc.).  The
      framework services are encapsulated in a standard CCA interface called a
      Services object.  The Services object is the real interface to the
      underlying framework and is used to retrieve ports, including the 
      BuilderService Port, which handles connections among components.

      The getServices method creates a new Services object that appears as a
      component instance in the Framework, effectively registering an image of
      the calling program as a component instance within the framework.
      Multiple Services objects may be created with different names from the
      same or different calling programs.

      The \em selfInstanceName parameter is the name given to the component
      instance. The \em selfClassName parameter is the component type of the
      calling program, as it will appear in the framework.  The
      \em selfProperties are the properties of the component instance (and may
      be null).  If the selfInstanceName is already in use by another component
      in the framework, this method will throw a CCAException.	 */

      no longer needed by the calling program.  This method invalidates the
      associated component image in the underlying framework and also
      invalidates any ComponentIDs or ConnectionIDs contained in the referenced
      Services  object. */

  /** Creates a new SCIRunFramework instance.  The new framework instance is

      which must uniquely define the type of the component.  The component
      instance is given the name ``name''.   If the instance name is not
      specified (i.e. the method is passed an empty string), then the component
      will be assigned a unique name automatically.

      This method is ``semi-private'' and intended to be called only by the
      BuilderService class.  It works by searching the list of ComponentModels
      (the ivar \em models) for a matching registered type, and then calling
      the createInstance method on the appropriate ComponentModel object. */

      the framework.  If the destroy operation is not completed in the maximum
      allowed number of seconds, or the referenced component does not exist,
      then a CCAException is thrown.

      Like createComponentInstance, this method is only intended to be called
      by the BuilderService class.  It searches the list of registered
      components (compIDs) for the matching component ID, unregisters it, finds
      the correct ComponentModel for the type, then calls
      ComponentModel::destroyInstance to properly destroy the component.
