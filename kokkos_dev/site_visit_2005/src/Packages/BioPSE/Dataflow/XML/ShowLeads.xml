    <summary>The ShowLeads module graphs a Matrix that has rows of potentials.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>The input matrix is rendered by interpreting each row in the
matrix as a time series of values.  So if you have a mxn matrix, you
will see m line graphs with n values per graph. If an upstream module
has set the units and timescale appropriately, the x-axis is (time) is
updated appropriately. </p>
      <p>Time units are displayed along the x-axis, where they are
taken as a string from the properties in the Matrix. </p>
      <p>The ShowLeads module properties are: time-units, time-start,
and time-end time-units; a string that displays along the x-axis. The
start and end time determine the values for time.</p>
      <p>The sliders at the top of the dialog are for choosing the row
indecies that you wish to display. The Vertical Scale slider is for
controlling the spacing that the graphs are drawn with, for example if
you wish to render each lead in exaclty the same space, then set the
Vertical Scale to 0.0.</p>
      <p>Dragging the yellow vertical bars in the graph window updates
the value displayed for each lead on the left side of the graph,
allowing for closer data inspection at each time step.</p>
