    <summary>Select a subset of a field.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        This module clips out a subset of a field.  The new field
        contains just the selected portion of the input field.
      </p>
      <p>

        The module runs in one of two different modes.  If a field
	is connected to the "Clip Field" port, the module will clip
	the input field such that only those elements inside of the
	clip field are preserved.  If no Clip Field is connected 
	then the GUI widget is used to select which portion of the
	input field to preserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The type of the field is preserved in the clip, as well as the
        data values if possible.  Some field types are structured and
        thus not clippable.  This includes the LatVolField, ImageField,
        and Scanline field types.  There is an Unstructure module that
        can be used to convert these fields to appropriately
        unstructured versions before clipping.
      </p>
      <p>
	Functional clipping has been deprecated from this module.  Use
	the new and much faster ClipByFunction module if that is needed.
