    <summary>Saves persistent field objects received from upstream modules.</summary>
    <description><p>Upon opening, the FieldWriter GUI defaults to the directory that the user sets for their SCIRUN_DATA environment variable.   Otherwise, the GUI will default to the directory where the user's SCIRun executable resides. The user can enter the name of a file that the matrix saves to. The file should have a .fld extension.  The default file name is MyField.  The user may also choose between a Binary or ASCII file format.</p>
