      Compute the derivative of a scalar field and output it as a
  vector field.

    <description>
      <p>The Gradient module computes the derivative of a scalar field
      and converts it to a vector field. The gradient is the
      derivative of three dimensions; the first component in the X
      direction, the second component in the Y direction, and the
      third component in the Z direction grid, computing the general
      direction of "flow" at a specific point on the geometry.</p>

      <p>Not all field types are supported by the Gradient module.  At
      this time only derivatives of TetVolMesh and LatVolMesh are
      supported.  The Gradient module has no GUI. If Gradient recieves
      as input a Field type it does not support, an error message
      appears in the Error frame of the SCIRun environment.</p>
