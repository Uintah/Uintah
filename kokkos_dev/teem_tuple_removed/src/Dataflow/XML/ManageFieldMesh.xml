    <summary>Extract and change the positions of the nodes in a mesh.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
      This module performs two simultanious operations.  First the
      locations of all the nodes in the "Input Field" are extracted
      into a matrix and sent to the "Output Matrix" port as an Nx3
      matrix, where N is the number of nodes in the field.  The
      positions are sent in xyz order.  This first operation works
      on any field type because it does not make changes to the field.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The second operation is optional.  If an "Input Matrix" is
      available then a new field is constructed containing a copy of
      the "Input Field" except that the node locations are replaced by
      the position data in the "Input Matrix".  The "Input Matrix" is
      expected to be Nx3, where N is the number of nodes in the field
      and the three columns represent xyz positions.  This operation
      requires the "Input Field" to be an editable mesh type.  The
      Unstructure module can be used to make uneditable meshes
      editable.
