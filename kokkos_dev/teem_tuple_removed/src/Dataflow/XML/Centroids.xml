    <summary>Computes a PointCloudField containing all of the element
  centers for a field.</summary>
    <description>
      The Centriods module computes a PointCloudField containing all
      of the element centers for a field.  For instance, if the input
      field is a TetVolField then the output field would contain the
      center of each tetrahedra.  An input PointCloudField would return
      the same data locations.

      The output field is always a PointCloudField of doubles, and
      contains no data.  If data is needed at the points then an
      interpolation module should be used to recover them.
