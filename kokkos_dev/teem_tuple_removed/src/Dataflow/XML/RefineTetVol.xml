    <summary>RefineTetVol subdivides or simplifies a TetVolField</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
Subdivide the input TetVolField, or simplify it.  Gui control allows
refinement of a single cell at a time, or refinement to a target
subdivision level for the entire field. A secont input field can be
input to control locally where and how much to refine the input field.
Note: simplification is not yet implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
The output field is a cell centered refined version of the input
field. The data indicates the current subdivision level for that tet.
Use ChangeFieldDataAt and DirectInterpolate to get data values for
calculation.
      </p>
      <p>
If a second input field is provided (port name: Refinement Control),
it must share a mesh with the first input field. It must be cell
centered int data. The int at each cell indicates to what level the
mesh should be refined at that position.  A positive int (i) indicates
subdivision to level i. (a 5 at cell n would indicate subdivision of
cell n until it is at least level 5).  A negative int (i) indicates
simplification to level i. A 0 at any cell indicates no change at all.
