CLASS
   HandlerStorage
   
KEYWORDS
   PIDL, Server
   
DESCRIPTION
   The HandlerStorage class is associated with a server
   and it's purpose is to store pointers to data in a location
   referenced by the handler number. The classes' purpose at
   this point is to store return data for NOCALLRET type of calls.
   The reason this classes was added is that current version of Globus
   Nexus used in the system does not allow for any kind of buffer copying.
   When the underlying communication mechanism is changed we can do away
   with this call and implement a more effecient buffer copy instead.
