    <summary>Permute slices along one axis.</summary>
    <description>
    <p>Slices along one axis are re-arranged as units according to 
    the given permutation (or its inverse). The permutation tells 
    which old slice to put at each new position. For example,
    the shuffle 0-1, 1-2, 2-0 would be 2 0 1.</p>
    <p>New Slice Ordering: one or more integers separated by white
    space indicating the new slice ordering.</p>
    <p>Use Inverse of Given Permutation checkbox will use the inverse
    of the permutation given above.</p>
    <p>Axis indicates the axis to shuffle along.</p>
