    <summary>Remove one or more singleton axes from a nrrd. Singleton axes
have only a single sample along them. The underlying linear ordering of the
samples is unchanged, and the information about the other axes is shifted
downwards as needed.</summary>
    <description>
     <p>Axis: indicates the axis at which to delete the stub axis and should be an integer. Iff you give -1 as the axis, this will do a matlab-style squeeze, in which any and all singleton axes are removed.</p>
