    <summary>Map nrrd through *regular* univariate map (colormap). A map is
regular if the control points are evenly spaced along the domain, and hence
their position isn't explicitly represented in the map; the axis min, axis
max, and number of points determine their location. The map can be a 1D nrrd
(for grayscale), in which case the output has the same dimension as the
input, or a 2D nrrd (for color), in which case the output has one more
dimension than the input. In either case, the output is the result of linearly
interpolating between map points, either scalar values (grayscale), or
scanlines along axis 0 (color).

    <p>Rescale to the Map Domain : rescale the input values from the input
     range to the map domain. The map domain is either explicitly defined 
     by the axis min,max along axis 0 or 1, or, it is implicitly defined 
     as zero to one minus the length of that axis.</p>
    <p>Min : Only used when rescaling to the Map Domain. Indicates the low 
    end of input range. Should be a double.</p>
    <p>Max : Only used when rescaling to the Map Domain. Indicates the high 
    end of input range. Should be a double.</p>
