    <summary>Map nrrd through univariate lookup table (itself represented as a
nrrd). The lookup table can be 1D, in which case the output has the same
dimension as the input, or 2D, in which case the output has one more dimension
than the input, and each value is mapped to a scanline (along axis 0) from the
lookup table.</summary>
    <description>
    <p>Rescale to the Lookup Table : indicates whether to rescale the input 
    values from the input range to the lut domain. The lut domain is either 
    explicitly defined by the axis min,max along axis 0 or 1, or, it is 
    implicitly defined as zero to the length of that axis.</p>
    <p>Min : Only used when rescaling to Lookup Table. Indicates the low 
    end of input range. Should be a double.</p>
    <p>Max : Only used when rescaling to Lookup Table. Indicates the high 
    end of input range. Should be a double.</p>
