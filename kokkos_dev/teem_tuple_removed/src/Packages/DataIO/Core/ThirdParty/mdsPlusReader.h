  This is a C++ interface for fetching data from a MDSPlus Server.

  Unfortunately, because MDSPlus has several short commings this interface
  is need is to provide a link between SCIRun and MDSPlus. The two items
  addressed are making MDSPlus thread safe and allowing seemless access to
  multiple servers and, or trees.
