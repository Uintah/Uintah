    <para>
      Nvidia drivers, versions 1.0-5328 and 1.0-5336, will not work for
      hardware based texture volume rendering in SCIRun.  Please do not
      update to these drivers if you wish your volume rendering to work.
    </para>

    <para>Driver versions 1.0-4496, 1.0-4363 are known to work.</para>

    <para>
      Driver version 1.0-4191 does not work.  SCI has not tested versions
      earlier than 1.0-4191&mdash;they may or may not work.

  <section id="intro.ati_notes">
    <title id="intro.ati_notes.title">Linux and ATI Graphics Cards Notes</title>

    <para>The SCI Institute has spent some time experimenting with the use
    of ATI graphics cards under the Linux operating system.  Several
    different ATI cards and several different flavors of Linux have been
    tried with mixed results:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>On one system, ATI drivers installed with apparent success, but
	the system did not report using the drivers and only software
	rendering appeared to be used.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Under Red Hat Enterprise the drivers installed and worked, but the
	graphics were very choppy, producing a mostly unusable rendering.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>On another system, drivers installed and were used but vertex
	arrays did not work, which caused some objects to be rendered
	incorrectly</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>One card did work well under Redhat 9.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Setting environment variable
	<envar>SCIRUN_DRAWARRAYS_DISABLE</envar> can be used to
	improve the usability of ATI cards.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    Based on these experiences, SCI does not recommend the use of ATI
    cards with &sr; software at this time.  We suggest the use of an
    NVidia card instead.  SCI investigate ATI cards further when
    ATI releases new drivers.
    </para>

    <title id="intro.redhat_ent_notes.title">Redhat Enterprise
    Notes</title> 

    <para>SCI has experienced a number of strange behaviors when running
    &sr; on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  We do not recommend running &sr; on
    this system at this time.  SCI will evaluate future versions of Redhat
    Enterprise</para>
