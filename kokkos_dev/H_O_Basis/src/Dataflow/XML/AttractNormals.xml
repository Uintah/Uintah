    <summary>Make a new vector field that points to the input point.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        This creates a new vector field containing the same geometry
        and data location as the input field.  It works in two modes.
        If the input PointCloudField contains only one point, all of the
        vectors in the output field will be attracted to that input
        point.  If the input PointCloudField contains two or more points,
        the first two points will be used as a line and all the
        vectors in the output field will be attracted to that line.
        If the input field contains scalar values, the vectors in the
        output field will be scaled by those values.  Otherwise they
        will all be normalized.

<title>AttractNormals Regression Test</title>

<p>Use AttractNormals to make a vector field all point to the same
location.  The location in this network is determined by a probe, but
it could be the first point of any input field.</p>

<p>This network can be found at src/nets/Modules/FieldsData/AttractNormals.net.</p>
