    <description>
      <p>GatherFields takes in an arbitrary number of input fields and
      gathers them all up into one output field.  If the input
      fields all have the same editable mesh type then the output
      field will also be of the same type.  If the meshes are not
      editable or of different mesh types then only their points
      will be gathered up and a single PointCloudField will be
      produced.</p>

      <p>The mesh type is not preserved for non-editable mesh types
      such as LatVolFields because they cannot be arbitrarily glued
      together while maintaining their mesh type.  Run the fields
      through the <modref package="SCIRun" name="Unstructure"/>
      module before passing them into GatherFields if you want the
      element structure to be preserved.</p>
