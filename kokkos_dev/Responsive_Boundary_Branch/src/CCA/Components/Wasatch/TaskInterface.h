   *  \brief Provides an interface to Uintah
   *
   *  The TaskInterface class provides an interface to Uintah for the
   *  ExpressionTree and Expression objects.  Each time this task is
   *  executed, the fields and operators are re-bound on all of the
   *  expressions.  This is because one ExpressionTree (and hence
   *  Uintah::Task) may be executed on multiple patches (data).
   *  Therefore, we must re-bind these to the data specific to the
   *  patch that they are being executed on.  Alternatively, a unique
   *  tree and set of expressions could be constructed for each
   *  patch. This would require more memory, however.
   *
   *  There are two main "modes" that a TaskInterface can be created
   *  to support:
   *
   *   - Create expressions and the associated ExpressionTree on each
   *      patch. This is required when setting boundary conditions,
   *      since this must modify expressions on boundary patches.
   *
   *   - Create expressions and the associated ExpressionTree only
   *     once. This will be executed on each patch. This will only be
   *     valid if all patches are homogeneous, i.e. no boundary
   *     conditions are being applied.
   *
   *  These modes are selected when the TaskInterface is constructed.
   *
   *  \todo for tree cleaving, we need to put MODIFIES flags on fields
   *        rather than COMPUTES or REQUIRES.  This might be a bit sticky.
