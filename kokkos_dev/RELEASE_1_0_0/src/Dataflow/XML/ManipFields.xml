        ManipFields is used to create a new Field from applying some operation
        (or manipulation) on one or more other fields.  Example operations
        include merging two (or more) fields into one field, clipping a field
        against a clipping plane, culling elements from a field based on some
        criteria, re-scaling or re-positioning a field's mesh.
