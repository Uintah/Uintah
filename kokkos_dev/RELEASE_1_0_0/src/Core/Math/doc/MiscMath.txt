MiscMath.h provides simple math utility functions that don't really
fit anywhere else.

The following functions have been implemented:

// Absolute value
double Abs(double);
int Abs(int);

// Signs
double Sign(double);
int Sign(int);

// Clamp a number to a specific range
double Clamp(double, double, double);
int Clamp(int, int, int);

// Generate a step between min and max.
// return:   min - if d<=min
//	     max - if d>=max
//	     hermite curve if d>min && d<max
double SmoothStep(double d, double min, double max);

// Interpolation:
double Interpolate(double d1, double d2, double weight)

// Integer/double conversions
double Fraction(double d)
int RoundDown(double d)
int Round(double d)
int Floor(double d)
int Ceil(double d)
int Tile(int tile, int tf)
