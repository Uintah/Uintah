    <summary>Fills in supplied sphere field with potentials values due
      to the specified dipoles</summary>

    <description>
      <p>Version Date: March 2001</p>
      <p>Version: 1.1</p>
      <p>The current version of the module provides analytical
	calculation of potential on the surface of supplied sphere. The
	sphere is assumed to have uniform conductivity equal 1. The
	center of the sphere is the center of the bounding box, and the
	radius is half of the maximum dimension of the box</p>

	  <p>The port takes handle to the matrix of size n-by-6,
	  contating parameters of n dipoles (the first three column are dipole
	  position, the other there are dipole moment). The dipoles
	  are assumed to lie inside the sphere. Otherwise warning
	  message is produced in the module log window</p>
