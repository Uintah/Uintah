\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


This is the \etitle{\srug}.  It describes the purpose and use of the \sr{}
problem solving environment.  It is for those users who will be building
and executing \dfn{networks} within the \sr{} environment.

Those who will be installing \sr{} should read the
\latexhtml{\srig{}\footnote{On the web see \installdocurl{}.  In the
    distribution see
    \filename{doc/InstallGuide/pseInstall.html}}}{\htmladdnormallink{\etitle{\srig{}}}{\installdocrurl}}

\subsection{Road Map}
\label{sec:roadmap}

This document is organized into the following main sections:

\begin{description}
\item \secref{Introduction}{sec:intro} You are reading this section now.
\item \secref{Concepts}{sec:concepts} Introduces the concept of an
  integrated problem solving environment generally and describes how \SR{}
  embodies some of these ideas.
\item \secref{Starting \sr}{sec:startingup}  Procedure for starting \sr{}
  and related information.
\item \secref{Working with Networks}{sec:workwithnets} Discusses tasks involved in
  building, editing, and executing networks.
\item \secref{Visualization with the \viewer{}}{sec:viewer} Describes the
  purpose and use of a visualization module called the \viewer{}.  The
  \viewer{} is probably \sr{}'s most commonly used module.
%\item \secref{Packages}{sec:packages} Describes the content of the \sr{}
%  and \pse{} packages (which provide nearly all of \sr{}'s computational
%  services). 
\end{description}

information related to \sr{} and the \scii{}.

\subsubsection{From the Mailing Lists}

The \sr{} users mail list is a forum for discussing \sr{} related issues.
To subscribe send mail to:

\mailto{Majordomo@cs.utah.edu}

with the following command in the body of your message:

\subsection{Reporting Bugs}
\label{sec:bugs}

Please report bugs!  To report a bug visit \sr{}'s
