<p class="head"><a name="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></p>
    <p class="firstpara">
      Use of this document requires experience with the SGI
      Irix operating system and/or the Linux operating system.
      Knowledge of file systems, programming in C/C++, building
      software from tarball distributions and shell scripting will
      be useful if not required.  The installation or upgrade of
      core system components (such as the OS and compilers) may be
      required.  As such, a system administrator's assistance may
      be warranted.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      The following information may help expedite the process of
      installing the required third party software.  However, It is not
      intended to replace the installation instructions, provided with
      the software, only to supplement them.  Please read the
      build instructions for each software distribution before attempting to
      use these instructions.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      This section does not apply to the installation and upgrade of
      the OS and build tools, as those topics are quite involved.
    </p>

<br><br><br>
<p class="head"><a name="Auto">Installation of Thirdparty Software (automatic)
</a></p>
    <p class="firstpara">
      Because of many bugs and gotchas in the thirdparty installation
      processes, the easiest and most dependable way to install the
      third party software is by using the thirdparty install script created
      by the SCI Institute.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      However, if you want or need to install the third party software by
      hand, you can continue by following the instructions on this page
      starting at <a href="#Install">Installation Location of Thirdparty
      Software (manual)</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      The automatic install script comes with all the necessary thirdparty
      software, and does not require you to download anything else.
    </p>
    
    <p class="firstpara">
      To use the automatic install script do the following:
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      <b>1.  Download the install script tar ball from <a href="">here</a>.</b>
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      <b>2.  Put the tar ball into a directory of your choosing.</b>
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      <b>3.  Unzip and untar the tar ball:</b>
    </p>

    <pre class="example"><font color=blue>gunzip Thirdparty_install.tar.gz
tar xvf Thirdparty_install.tar</font></pre>

    <p class="firstpara">
      <b>4.  Run the install script by typing:</b>
    </p>

    <pre class="example"><font color=blue>python install</font></pre>

    <p class="firstpara">
      <b>5.  Continue on to <a href="#Environment">Environment Variables</a>
      </b>.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      The install script will create a directory named SCIRun_Thirdparty_32 
      in the directory chosen in step 2 above.  When it finishes, it will
      display a message regarding the --with-thirdparty SCIRun configure 
      option.  Cut and paste that option when running the configure command
      for SCIRun (see step 2 of <a href="pseInstall.html#Building">Building
      SCIRun</a>).
    </p>
      
<br><br><br>
<p class="head"><a name="Install">Installation Location of Third Party Software
(manual)</a></p>
    <p class="firstpara">
      SCIRun can easily be used with existing instances of the
      required third party software, regardless of where it is
      installed.  However, it is recommended that all the
      required third party software be installed into a centralized and
	  out of the way location, to prevent conflicts with other software,
	  if it is not yet already installed.
    </p>
    
    <p class="firstpara">
      For example, install all the third party software into the
      directory called "/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty_32" such that
      after installing all the distributions, the 
      /usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty_32 directory has the
      following contents:
    </p>

    <pre class="example">/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty_32/tcl8.3.2
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty_32/tk8.3.2
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty_32/itcl3.1.0
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty_32/blt2.4u
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty_32/xerces-c-src1_4_0
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty_32/make-3.79.1
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty_32/man
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty_32/lib
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty_32/bin
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty_32/include
    </pre>

    <p class="firstpara">
      Where all the executable binaries are in the /bin directory, all
      the shared object binaries are in the /lib directory and all 
      the header files are in the /include directory.
    </p>
        
    <br><br><br>
<p class="head"><a name="Configure">Configure Options for Third Party Software (manual)</a></p>
      
    <p class="firstpara">
      The following represent the recommended configure
      commands for the indicated software distributions.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      NOTE: <i><b><font color=green>INST_DIR</font></b></i> represents
      the chosen installation directory for the indicated software
      distribution.  <i><b><font color=green>INST_DIR</font></b></i>
      would be "/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty_32" for the example given
      above.

<br><br><br>
<p class="head"><a name="Environment">Environment Variables (automatic and manual)</a></p>
    <p class="firstpara">
      Once the third party software is properly installed, set or edit 
      environment variables to use those executables and libraries.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      Usually, depending on the startup shell being used, there are two
      environment variables that may need to be edited: one defining the
      search path for executables and the other defining the search path
      for libraries.  Edit (or set) those variables, for the shell being
      used, to include the third party executables located in the /bin
      directory(s) and to include the the third party libraries located
      in the /lib directory(s).
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      As before, <i><b><font color=green>INST_DIR</font></b></i> represents
      the chosen installation directory.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      For csh or tcsh:
    </p>

    <pre class="example">setenv PATH <i><b><font color=green>INST_DIR</font></b></i>/bin:$PATH</pre>
    <pre class="example">setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH <i><b><font color=green>INST_DIR</font></b></i>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</pre>

    <p class="firstpara">
      For bash or ksh:
    </p>

    <pre class="example">export PATH=<i><b><font color=green>INST_DIR</font></b></i>/bin:$PATH</pre>
    <pre class="example">export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<i><b><font color=green>INST_DIR</font></b></i>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</pre>

    <p class="firstpara">
      Note that if the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables were not already set,
      then the trailing :$PATH and/or :$LD_LIBRARY_PATH are not needed and may
      cause the command to fail.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      Also, for machines using rld (e.g. SGI machines) the environment 
      variable named above as LD_LIBRARY_PATH may need to changed to
      LD_LIBRARY32_PATH or LD_LIBRARY64_PATH depending upon the machine's
      default ABI (Application Binary Interface).
    </p>

<br><br><br>
<p class="head"><a name="Gotchas">Known Issues (automatic and manual)</a></p>
    <p class="firstpara">
      This section describes known issues with installing and building the
      required third party software.  It also includes solutions when
      available. 
    </p>

<p class="subhead">Path Specifications</p>
    <p class="firstpara">
     If any of the software, SCIRun or thirdparty, is installed into a user's
     home directory, <i><b>do not</b></i> use abbreviations such as tilde
     expansion when specifying paths.  Instead, use full absolute paths.
     For example, use /home/bob/SCIRun instead of ~bob/SCIRun for the 
     --prefix arguments when configuring.  Most abbreviation techniques will
     not get expanded by the build scripts for any of the software.
    </p>

<p class="subhead">Building with 64 bit enabled on SGI</p>
    <p class="firstpara">
      Unfortunately, most of the required third party software didn't have
      64 bit SGI platforms in mind when they wrote their configure scripts
      and makefiles.  However, it is possible to build all the software in
      64 bit with some effort.  In general, to get 64 bit versions of the
      third party software it is necessary to edit Makefiles such that
      the CFLAGS and LFLAGS macros have "-64" listed instead of "-n32".
      In the case of the tcl distributions, this means editing the
      makefiles (after configuring) by hand and replacing all instances of 
      "-n32" with "-64".  Getting xerces to build in 64 bits is a little
      more complicated: first start the runConfigure script as usual, then
      (before making) type the export commands indicated at the conclusion
      of the runConfigure script verbatim with the exception that you
      insert "-64" into the CFLAGS and LFLAGS environment variables.
    </p>

<p class="subhead">Building [incr Tcl/Tk]</p>
    <p class="firstpara">
      The [incr Tcl/Tk] distribution listed in the system requirements has a
      bug in it:  The installation scripts are bundled without execute
      permissions.  Before attempting to configure or make [incr Tcl/Tk],
      type the following commands:
    </p>

    <pre class="example"><font color=blue>cd itcl3.1.0/config
chmod a+x install-sh mkinstalldirs</font></pre>

    <p class="firstpara">
      Then, proceed normally with the configure and make.
    </p>

<p class="subhead">Building BLT</p>
    <p class="firstpara">
      The BLT make files have bugs in them that prevent building the necessary
      shared object libraries.  To build the necessary files type the following
      , after configuring:
    </p>

    <pre class="example"><font color=blue>cd blt2.4u
make 
cd src/shared
make 
cd blt2.4u
make -k install
cd src/shared
make -k install</font>
    </pre>

<p class="subhead">Building Xerces-c</p>
    <p class="firstpara">
      The make system for Xerces-c is not standard and has many bugs.  The
      following all apply after configuring xerces.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      The configure scripts are bundled without execute permissions.  Before
      attempting to configure or make Xerces-C, type the following commands:
    </p>

    <pre class="example"><font color=blue>cd xerces-c-src1_4_0/src
chmod a+x configure runConfigure</font></pre>

    <p class="firstpara">
      Then, proceed normally with the configure and make.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      After typing "make", but before compilation begins, the make system
      copies certain files around.  This copying is not specified in any
      dependancy tree, so using a -j flag (use multiple threads) as a make
      argument will cause the build to fail.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      There is no dependancy tree for the "install" target within the make
      files, so passing install as an argument to the first time "make" is
      typed will cause the build to fail.  Instead type "make" first, then
      "make install".
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      The make system ignores errors in compilation and forces a link.  Verify
      that the build was actually successful by checking the size of 
      libxerces-c1_4.so.  The sizes should be: ~2.1MB for SGI 32 bit, ~2.4MB
      for SGI 64 bit, and ~1.4MB for linux.
    </p>
