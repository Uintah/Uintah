<A NAME="overview">
<H3> Overview </H3>

SCIRun source code is stored in a CVS repository.  CVS is a file
revision control tool which facilitates multiple users developing the
same source codes at the same time. It maintains a history of what has
changed in a file, who made the change, and when it occurred, and
allows for tagging a specific level of codes as a version release.
<P>

In order to check out a copy of the SCIRun source code from the
repository, you must do the following:

<UL>
  <LI> Have a CS computer account created for you.  Get access to
  csf.cs.utah.edu.  Be added to the appropriate unix groups (csafe,
  scirun, biopse, etc.)  See the complete <A HREF="">New User's
  Checklist</A> for more details.<P>

  <LI> Set the following unix environment variables.  You will
  probably want to do this in you .cshrc file so that they will
  be set each time you log in:
    <UL>
      <LI><I>setenv CVSROOT csf.cs.utah.edu:/csafe_noexport/cvs/cvsroot</I>
      <LI><I>setenv CVS_RSH ssh</I>
    </UL><P>

  <LI>Create a working directory for the copy of the files that
  you will be editing. <P>

  <LI>Change directories to the working directory. <P>

  <LI><B>NOTE:</B> When running cvs commands, you may be querried
  for your password, depending on whether you have a .rhosts/.shosts
  file and where you are logging in from. If so, just type in your
  password. The examples below do not show a password query. <P>

  <LI>Checkout all or part of the repository that you are interested
  in. To do this, run the following CVS command: "cvs checkout
  SCIRun".<P>

</UL>

<P>

<A NAME="cvs">
<H3> CVS </H3>

Once you have a copy of the source tree, you are free to edit and
check in source files using CVS.  Here are the main CVS commands you
will likely use:

<UL>
  <LI> <I>cvs update [-d]</I>:  When typed from within your working
  directory, this command will copy all files that have been updated
  in the repository (usually by other people) into your working
  directory.  Any files that you have also modified will be marked
  with the differences.  The "-d" argument is optional, and tells
  CVS to bring in new directories.  By default, new directories added
  to the repository are not added to your working directory.
  <P>
  <LI> <I>cvs status <filename></I>: Tells you about <filename>.
  <P>
  <LI> <I>cvs log <filename></I>: Gives you the update log on <filename>.
  <P>
  <LI> <I>cvs diff <filename></I>: Shows you the differences between
  <filename> in your working directory, and the most recent version in
  the repository.
</UL>

<A NAME="cvsMailingList">

If you are interested in being notified when any source files are
modified, you may use majordomo to subscribe to either (or both) of
"scirun-cvs" or "csafe-cvs" mailing lists.

<P>

Send mail to majordomo@cs.utah.edu with the following in the body of
the e-mail:

<UL>
  <LI> You get "Permission Denied" when checking out or updating your
       working directory.  This is (usually) caused when someone has
       added a new directory to the repository.  When a new directory
       is created, CVS (incorrectly) sets the permissions to the
       defaults of directory's creator.  Either a superuser or the
       owner of the directory may go to the cvs repository on csf and
       fix the file permissions.
