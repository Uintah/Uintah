<p class="title">SCIRun Makefile design rationale</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Make is an essential part of the compilation process.  It manages
the dependencies between different software libraries, and provides a
mechanism to describe "what goes into" a software packages.  Due to
the size of SCIRun and the number of different ways that it is being
used, the makefiles in SCIRun have become especially important.

<p>In the beginning, SCIRun used imake from the X windows
distribution.  This worked great for many things, but relied on a slew
of convoluted C preprocessor macros that nobody really understood.
Then, John McCorquodale took over the brave job of converting to the
use of GNU autoconf.  Autoconf is also a preprocessor (and just as
convoluted), but is easier to configure for the average mortal.

<p>Both of these approaches used a makefile per subdirectory.  So,
they shared a common weakness: dependencies between directories are
not adequately represented.  Then, Thant Tesseman introduced me to
this paper: <a
href="http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~millerp/rmch/recu-make-cons-harm.html">Recursive
make considered harmful</a>, which described a methodology to use a
single makefile to get around this problem.  I have adopted a
variation of this strategy here.  It still uses autoconf, but only
build the "top level" Makefile, instead of a Makefile in each
subdirectory.

<h1>Features</h1>

<ol>
 <li> There is no more recursive make - it analyzes the entire tree at
   once
 <li> most makes should be faster - especially when there isn't very much
   to rebuild
 <li> parallel builds should be much faster
 <li> You no longer have to cd to the right directory to build the right .so
 <li> Compilation targets are now in a file called sub.mk in each
   directory, which is very simple for most directories.
 <li> We new have a better way of building multiple executables, such as
   the "convert" directories of old.
 <li> Fewer .d files on irix - there is now one per directory.
 <li> No more addfile Fred/Foo/Makefile to the configure.in
 <li> No more --enable-Fred options, use --enable-package="Uintah Fred" 
   instead.
 <li> All of the .so's get built into a single "lib" directory, which
   makes the management of -rpath much simpler.
 <li> configures are much faster (39 seconds to 6 seconds on a crude benchmark)
 <li> You can configure with --enable-largesos to build a few large
   shared libraries.  The default (--disable-largesos) builds many
   small .sos, in an effort to reduce build times.  If you ever switch
   from largeso to smallso or vice-vera - make sure that you do a make
   clean BEFORE you make the switch.
</ol>


There are a few disadvantages to the new system:
<ol>
 <li> Because of the make dependencies, it will rebuild all of the shared
   libraries that depend on another shared library.  This can be very
   tedious if you are changing a lower-level library. To get around
   this, type something like "gmake lib/libPSECommon_Modules_Salmon.so"
 <li> Parallel makes are no longer the default.  Use gmake -j 64 to
   thrash rapture and build really fast.  Perhaps we will need to come
   up with some etiquette.
</ol>

<h1>Basic approach</h1>

<p>There is a single "top-level" makefile.  It recursively includes
makefile fragments for other subdirectories.  In this fashion,
dependencies between directories are preserved.  The makefile
fragments in each subdirectory are called "sub.mk", and are designed
to be terse.

<p>There are five different basic functions for the makefiles:
<ul>
  <li>Top-level makefile: Defines a number of variables (some of which
are substituted from autoconf
  <li>Recursion.  One defines the variable SUBDIRS, and includes
recurse.mk, which performs the actual recursion.  Here is an example:
<pre>
SUBDIRS := $(SRCDIR)/ThirdParty $(SRCDIR)/Modules $(SRCDIR)/GUI

include $(SRCTOP)/scripts/recurse.mk
</pre>
  <li>Building a library.  One includes the appropriate so_prologue,
defines the sources for this directory, defines the other SCIRun
libraries used to link this library, and any other (external)
libraries.  Finally, it includes the so_epilogue which generates the
rules for the subdirectory.  Here is an example:
<pre>
include $(SRCTOP)/scripts/smallso_prologue.mk

SRCDIR   := PSECommon/Modules/FEM

SRCS     += $(SRCDIR)/ApplyBC.cc $(SRCDIR)/BuildFEMatrix.cc \
	$(SRCDIR)/ComposeError.cc $(SRCDIR)/ErrorInterval.cc \
	$(SRCDIR)/FEMError.cc $(SRCDIR)/MeshRefiner.cc

PSELIBS := PSECore/Dataflow PSECore/Datatypes SCICore/Datatypes \
	SCICore/Persistent SCICore/Thread SCICore/Containers \
	SCICore/Exceptions SCICore/TclInterface SCICore/Geometry
LIBS := 

include $(SRCTOP)/scripts/smallso_epilogue.mk
</pre>
  <li>Build a tclIndex file.  This one is not automated but is very
simple, such as:
<pre>
SRCDIR := SCICore/GUI

ALLTARGETS := $(ALLTARGETS) $(SRCDIR)/tclIndex

$(SRCDIR)/tclIndex: $(SRCDIR)/BaseDial.tcl $(SRCDIR)/ColorPicker.tcl \
	$(SRCDIR)/DebugSettings.tcl $(SRCDIR)/Dial.tcl \
	$(SRCDIR)/Dialbox.tcl $(SRCDIR)/Doublefile.tcl \
	$(SRCDIR)/Filebox.tcl $(SRCDIR)/HelpPage.tcl \
	$(SRCDIR)/Histogram.tcl $(SRCDIR)/MaterialEditor.tcl \
	$(SRCDIR)/MemStats.tcl $(SRCDIR)/PointVector.tcl \
	$(SRCDIR)/ThreadStats.tcl $(SRCDIR)/Util.tcl \
	$(SRCDIR)/VTRDial.tcl
	$(SRCTOP)/scripts/createTclIndex $(SRCTOP)/SCICore/GUI

CLEANPROGS := $(CLEANPROGS) $(SRCDIR)/tclIndex
</pre>
<li>Creating an executable program.  One sets the SRCS, PROGRAM,
PSELIBS and LIBS variables, and includes program.mk.  Here is an example.
<pre>
SRCS := $(SRCDIR)/Spec.cc $(SRCDIR)/SymbolTable.cc $(SRCDIR)/emit.cc \
	$(SRCDIR)/main.cc $(SRCDIR)/parser.y $(SRCDIR)/scanner.l \
	$(SRCDIR)/static_check.cc

PROGRAM := $(SRCDIR)/sidl
PSELIBS :=
LIBS :=

include $(SRCTOP)/scripts/program.mk
</pre>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the top-level Makefile, a Makefile will get created
(by the first make) in each subdirectory.  This is simply a
convenience to allow the user to type "make" in any subdirectory.  It
will change directories to the top of the source tree and build the
entire tree.

<h1>FAQ</h1>
We will update this as questions get frequently asked.  Here are a few
that I anticipate:

<ol>
  <li><ul>
        <li><b>Question:</b> What does this mean: gmake: Circular lib/libSCICore_Containers.so <- lib/libSCICore_Persistent.so dependency dropped.
	<li><b>Answer:</b> It means that you have a circular
dependency between two different libraries.  You need to examine the
PSELIBS variable for the two libraries (SCICore/Containers and
SCICore/Persistent in this case) and make it so that they do not
depend on one another.  This may require changing the code, but it is
a cleaner design, so it should be done anyway.
      </ul>
  <li><ul>
        <li><b>Question:</b> How can I build multiple executables in a
single directory.
	<li><b>Answer:</b> See DaveW/convert for an example
      </ul>
</ol>

<h1>Adding a file to a subdirectory</h1>
Simply add the file to the SRCS list in the sub.mk for that directory.

<h1>Adding a new subdirectory</h1>
Add the directory to the SUBDIRS list in the sub.mk for the parent
directory.  Then use this to create the sub.mk in your new directory.
You will need to fill in the @...@ values.

<h1>Building a new shared object</h1>
These are done one per directory.  If you have some creative need for
something different, please talk to Steve.

<a name="configure"></a>
<h1>Configure and configure options</h1>

<table border="2" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>--enable-package</td><td>Compile the listed packages.  SCIRun 
modules are compiled automatically.  To also build the BioPSE and
Uintah modules, use:
--enable-package="BioPSE Uintah".</td></tr>
<tr><td>--enable-exename</td><td>Overrides the default executable name
for SCIRun.  The default is scirun.</td></tr>
<tr><td>--enable-threads</td><td>Threads are always enabled, but this
allows one to use a different implementation.  On the SGI,
--enable-threads=pthreads and --enable-threads=sproc (default) are
supported.  On other platforms, only --enable-threads=pthreads is
supported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>--enable-debug</td><td>Turn on debugging.  To simply use "-g",
just use --enable-debug.  To use flags other than "-g", use
--enable-debug="-myflags".</td></tr>

just use --enable-optimize.  To use flags other than "-O2", use
--enable-optimize="-myflags".</td></tr>
<tr><td>--enable-largesos</td><td>Instead of building a shared object
per subdirectory, build a few "large" shared objects for the top level
subdirectories.  This is more appropriate for distribution, and
