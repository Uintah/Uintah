    <summary>Interpolate Source field onto the Destination field.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        DirectInterpolate generates a new field that contains the
        geometry of the destination field, but with all of the
        data values linearly interpolated from the source field.
        It should work correctly with all of the current field
        and data types.  The data will be stored at the elements
        specified in the destination field.  Elements that are not
        within the source field are set to their closest in-field
        values.
