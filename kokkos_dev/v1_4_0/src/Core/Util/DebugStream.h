// DebugStream.h - An ostream used for debug messages
// Written by:

// DebugStream is an ostream that is useful for outputing debug messages.
// When an instance is created, it is given a name.  An environment variable,
// SCI_DEBUG, is inspected to see if a particular instance should be
// active(identified by its name), and if so where to send the output.
// The syntax for the environment variable is:
// SCI_DEBUG = ([name]:[-|+|+FILENAME])(,[name]:[-|+|+FILENAME])*
// The + or - specifies wheather the named object is on or off.  If a file is 
// specified it is opened in ios::out mode.  If no file is specified,
// the stream is directed to cerr.  The : and , characters are
// restricted to deliminators.
// Example:
// SCI_DEBUG = modules.meshgen.warning:+meshgen.out,util.debugstream.error:-
// Future Additions:
// o Possible additions to constructor:
//   - Default file to output to
//   - Mode that the file will be opened in (append, out, etc.) (usefulness??)
// o Allow DEFAULT specification in the env variable which would override
//   all default settings. (usefulness??)
// o Time stamp option
// Annoyances:
// o Because the list of environment variables, "environ", is built at
// run time, and getenv queries that list, I have not been able to
// figure out a way to requery the environment variables during
// execution.
