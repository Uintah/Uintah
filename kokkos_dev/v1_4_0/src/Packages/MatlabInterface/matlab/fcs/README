  INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN THE FOCUSING TEST
--------------------------------------------------

1) Change scirun.bat such that the path in 
   it points to location of scirun executable
   on your machine. Matlab should be in the
   path (check that by typing "which matlab")

2) execute SCIRun with the command:

   scirun.bat prepare.net

   and run the net within the SCIRun.
   This will produce files f.mat and dd.mat
   (sensitivity and data matrices).

3) Destroy Matlab module manually 
   (to shut down the matlab)
   and quit SCIRun environment

4) execute SCIRun again, with the command:
  
   scirun.bat fcs.net

   and run the net. This will produce file
   res.mat (result of focusing inversion)

5) Destroy Matlab module manually 
   (to shut down the matlab)
   and quit SCIRun environment

All files are ascii. f is 100*900 random
matrix, dd is vector (100 points) and res
is vector of 900 points. Open res.mat
and see for yourself that it is really
sparse solution.
