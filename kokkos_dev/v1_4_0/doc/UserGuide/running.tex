\section{Starting \sr{}}
\label{sec:startingup}

\subsection{The \command{scirun} Command}
\label{sec:sciruncmd}

Start \sr{} by typing \keyboard{scirun} in a terminal (\eg \command{xterm})
window.  \note{Don't start \sr{} in the background, \ie don't type
\keyboard{scirun \&}}.

The \command{scirun} command is located in the
\directory{src} directory of the \directory{\sr} install directory.  The
person who installed \sr{} can locate this command for you.

  \caption{\label{fig:srwindow} \sr{} Main Window}
\end{figure}


Typing \keyboard{scirun} with no arguments starts up \sr{} with a blank \sr{}
window as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:srwindow}.  The main features of this
window are discussed in \secref{Anatomy of the Main
  Window}{sec:windowanatomy}.

The \command{scirun} command may take 1 argument
which is the name of a \sr{} \dfn{network} \index{network} file (these
files have a \filename{.net} extension).  These files hold previously
defined \sr{} networks.  \sr{} will load the specified network.  Network
files will be discussed in a later section.

\sr{} may encounter errors during start up.  These will be displayed in
\sr{}'s error message pane (see Figure~\ref{fig:srwindow}).  These errors
should be \htmladdnormallink{reported}{\bugsurl} to the \sr{} development
team.  \latexonly{See \secref{Reporting Bugs}{sec:bugs} for information on
  reporting bugs.}

\subsection{Anatomy of the Main Window}
\label{sec:windowanatomy}

The \sr{} main window consists of 4 main components (see
Figure~\ref{fig:srwindow}): 

\begin{description}
\item[Menu Bar] The menu bar is used to load networks, save networks, quit
  \sr, create network modules, and perform other tasks.  The menu bar
  consists of the following menu items:

  \begin{description}
  \item[\menu{File}] The \menu{File} menu contains the following items:
    \begin{description}
    \item[Save] Saves the current network to a file.
    \item[Load] Loads a network from a file.
    \item[New] This sub-menu contains items of interest to developers only.
    \item[Add Info] Use this item to add network specific notes to
      the current network.  Notes should be used to document the purpose of
      the network.
    \item[Quit] Quits \sr.
    \end{description}
  \end{description}
  
  \begin{description}
  \item[\menu{SCIRun}] The \menu{SCIRun} menu is used to create modules
    (from the \sr{} package) for use in the network pane.  This menu is
    composed of sub-menus. Each sub-menu corresponds to a \dfn{category}
    \index{category} within the \sr{} package.  A category is a group of
    related modules.  Each menu item in a category sub-menu creates a
    specific module and places it in the network pane.  The network pane's
    pop-up menu (activated by clicking the right most mouse button when the
    mouse pointer is in the network pane) also provides access to the
    \menu{\sr{}} and \menu{\pse{}} (and possibly other) package menus.  An
    overview of the contents of the \sr{} package is given in \secref{The
      \pse{} Package}{sec:biopsepackage}.
  \end{description}

  \begin{description}
  \item[\menu{BioPSE}] The \menu{BioPSE} menu is used to create modules
    (from the \pse package) for use in the network pane.  It consists
    of category sub-menus and module menu items.   An overview of the
    contents of the \sr{} package is given in \secref{The SCIRun
      Package}{sec:srpackage}.
  \end{description}

  \begin{description}
  \item [\textit{Other Package Menus}] There may be other package
    menus if other packages have been installed.  They too will consist
    of category sub-menus and module menu items.
  \end{description}
  
\item[Navigator Pane] The Navigator Pane is located in the upper left
  corner of the main window (see Figure~\ref{fig:srwindow}). It is used to
  navigate complex networks.  The use of the Navigator Pane will be
  described in \secref{Navigating a Network}{sec:navnetwork}.
  
\item[Error Pane] Errors during program startup are displayed in the Error
  Pane.  It is located in the upper right corner of the main window(see
  Figure~\ref{fig:srwindow}).  Errors on startup may mean that \sr{} has
  been installed incorrectly or has been installed from a buggy
  distribution.  Please \hyperref{report}{(see Section~}{)}{sec:bugs} these
  errors.
  
\item[Network Pane] The Network Pane occupies the bottom of the main
  window(see Figure~\ref{fig:srwindow}).  It is used to build and execute
  networks.  \secref{Building Networks}{sec:workwithnets} discusses the use
  of this pane.

\end{description}

\subsection{The Terminal Window}
\label{sec:termwinapp}

After starting, \sr{} will also run a shell-like application in the
terminal window called the \dfn{\sr{} shell}.  The \sr{} shell displays the
prompt \screen{scirun\ra}.  This program is actually a modified \dfna{Tool
  Command Language}{TCL} shell program and it is possible to type in
\acronym{TCL}'ish \sr{} commands at the prompt. The use of this program
will be described in \hyperref{a later section}{Section~}{}{sec:termapp}.


\subsection{\envvar{SCIRUN\_DATA}}
\label{sec:scirundata}

The environment variable \envvar{SCIRUN\_DATA} specifies the default
directory of \sr{} data files.  \sr will first look in this directory to
find data and network files.  It affects the behavior of file browsing
dialogs -- they will prompt for a file within the \envvar{SCIRUN\_DATA}
directory (of course you may have the dialog look elsewhere).


\subsection{Stopping}
\label{sec:stopping}

Quit \sr{} by selecting the \menuitem{Quit} item from the \menu{File} menu

\warning{Don't press \keyboard{control-c} to exit \sr.  Doing this will drop you into
a debugger which is probably not what you want to do}.
