    <p><b>Chapter Overview</b><br>
    
    <p>In this first chapter, we will construct a SCIRun network
    [link to 4.0 UG working with networks] to perform a visualization task:
    rendering of a
    tetrahedral mesh.  Our &quot;net,&quot will consist of three
    modules: data reader, geometry converter, and renderer.<br> 
    
 
    <p>We will read the <dfn>Field</dfn> data from a file, set some rendering
    properties for the nodes, edges, and faces (the
    nodes will be rendered as blue spheres), and render the
    geometry to the screen in an interactive Viewer window.<br>  
    
    <p>To begin, we will construct a net from scratch (as shown,
    completed, in <b>Figure 1.1</b>). In the chapters that follow, we will
    expand on this network, adding more features and
    functionality as we progress.<br>

    <p>You should set two environment variables in your shell
     before starting SCIRun [link to 3.0 UG Starting SCIRun].  
<ol>
  <li value="1.">The SCIRUN_DATA variable points to the location 
  of the SCIRunData directory on your system.  
  <li value="2.0">The SCIRUN_DATASET variable indicates which dataset to load
  [since many of our example networks run with a variety of inputs|<clarify>].
</ol> 

<p>For example, we will construct a network that loads a geometric mesh
from disk and renders it to the screen. Such a network will work on a wide
variety of inputs.  The SCIRUN_DATASET variable selects the data set of
interest.<br>

<p>To begin, in your Unix shell window:
<ol>
  <li value="1.">Set your SCIRUN_DATA variable, pointing to the
  location of SCIRun data.  
  <li value="2.">Set your SCIRUN_DATASET variable to utahtorso-lowres
  (as shown in <b>Figure 1.2.</b>)</ol>

    <p> We have just loaded the SCIRun
    Field dataset.  A Field contains a geometric mesh and
    a collection of data values mapped onto that mesh.  In this case,
    we use a tetrahedral mesh with voltages defined at the nodes of the
    mesh.  The brief overview below describes the various types
    of geometric meshes, data values, and mappings that SCIRun
    supports.
    
    <p><A name="#section 2"><b>Overview of field types</A></b><br>
    
    <p>SCIRun has eight different geometric meshes
    available for Fields:

    <p>In a field, there are, at most, four different places in which
    data can be stored: nodes, edges, faces, and cells.  The
    dimensionality of the mesh type limits
    the available storage locations. For instance, a TriSurf has nodes,
    edges, and planar faces, but not cells, which we assume to be
    three-dimensional elements.  As a result, a TriSurf cannot store any
    data in cells--but it can store data in edges or faces.
    
    <p>The following data types can be stored in a field:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tensor
      <li>Vector
      <li>double precision
      <li>float(ing point)
      <li>int(eger)
      <li>short (integer)
      <li>char
      <li>unsigned int(eger)
      <li>unsigned short (integer)
      <li>unsigned char<br>
    </ul>
    <p><br>

    <p><b><A name="#section 3">ShowField module</b><br></A>
    
    <p>We will now add a second module to our network.  

    Select ShowField from the SCIRun/Visualization menu. 
    (Use this module to visualize various field types).

<!-- [|<Here we need an image, number 1.6, of the network with the two -->
<!-- modules in the network editor, but not connected. -->


    <p><b><A name="#section 4">Hooking modules together</b><br></A>
    
    <p>You will now connect the two modules in your canvas so that data can 
    flow between them.  The Output port in SCIRun is always on the bottom
    of the module,
    whereas the Input ports are always on top. Each datatype in SCIRun that
    can pass
    through ports has a unique color. You may connect ports of the same color.
                  
    <p>To hook the modules together:
    <ol>       
      <li value="1.">Position the
      mouse's pointer over the yellow output port on
      the FieldReader (<b>Figure 1.7.1</b>). Now press and hold down
      the mouse's middle button. You will see the name of
      the port and lines that indicate possible connections.
      <li value="2."> Drag your middle mouse toward the ShowField input
      Field port (yellow). 
      <li>When the line turns red (<b>Figure 1.7.2</b>), release the mouse
	  button. 
      <li>You should see a yellow bar showing a data flow connection
	  between FieldReader and ShowField (<b>Figure 1.7.3</b>).
      <LI>If you ever make an incorrect connection, just click on that
	  connection with the right mouse button and start again.

    <p><b><A name="#section 3">Setting the ShowField User Interface</b><br></A>

    
    <p>ShowField has a User Interface (UI) option for rendering a field's
    geometer, and special options for rendering vector data.
    ShowField can use color to represent data within
    the geometry, if desired.  For now, we will 
    render blue spheres as the nodes of the geometry.
    <ol><li value="1.">Select the UI button on the ShowField
      module(<b>Figure 1.8</b>).
    </ol>

    </center>
    <div align="left">
    
    <p>We will display the Field's nodes as
    spheres and set their color to blue:<br>
    
    <ol>
      <li value= "2.">Select the Default Color button
      near the bottom of the dialogue to change the default color.    
      <li >When a new dialogue with red, green, and blue sliders
      appears,  
      set red and green to 0.0, and blue to 1.00.  
      <li>Select the &quot;OK&quot; button in this color dialogue.  
      <li >Select &quot;Cancel&quot; to remove the dialogue from
      view. 
      <li>Change the Node Scale to 2 and set the Sphere Resolution
	  to 5. 
      <li>Turn off the display of edges and faces.  
      <li>Select the Edges tab in the ShowField dialogue.  
      <li>Turn off Show Edges.
      <li>Select the Faces tab.  
      <li>Turn off Show Faces.  
      <li>The ShowField module is now ready to render the nodes as blue
	  spheres. 
      <li> Next, press the "Execute" button on the ShowField UI
      that forces the module to execute its algorithm.
    </ol><br>

    <p>ShowField works with any of the SCIRun Field data types.
    However, you will notice a delay when ShowField is asked to
    visualize a Field data type for the first time--this is because
    the data type must be first compiled into a shared library (which
    is saved for future runs of SCIRun).  See <a
    href="http://www.sci.utah.edu/publications/mcole01/dyn.pdf">Dynamic
    Compilation</a> for more information.

    <!--
    <p>Since we have compiled only algorithms with an
    exact field type, this information becomes known only after a module
    receives its input data. We accomplish this by using <a
    href="http://www.sci.utah.edu/publications/mcole01/dyn.pdf">Dynamic
    Compilation</a>. <br>
    
    <p>You will notice a delay when ShowField executes for the first time. 
    This happens when the module compiles the algorithm specific to the
    field type, and loads it
    into SCIRun.  We cache away this compiled algorithm in a
    shared library, loading it without delay the next time you run
    SCIRun.

    <p>ShowField will then execute the newly loaded algorithm
    passing its results to downstream modules.

    [|<I think this is redundant and too deep the tutorial, Rob>]--->


    <p><b><A name="#section 5">Viewer module</b><br></A>
    
    <p>The Viewer module is the last that we will add to our
    network. 
    <ol>
      <li>Locate the Viewer under the SCIRun/Render
	  menu.  
      <li>Connect the output port from ShowField into the Viewer
	  input port.   As a result, the Viewer module has generated a new
	  input port. The Viewer provides an example of SCIRun modules that
	  have dynamic input ports.
      <LI> To generate a Viewer window press the Viewer's UI button.
      <LI> In the Viewer window, you will see a set of orthogonal axes as
	  arrows.  Now look for the button near the bottom called
	  Autoview; press that and you should see the points of the
	  geometry, something like in <b>Figure 1.10</b>  
      <LI> Things may not look quite like should, so see the next section
	  for directions on manipulating the Viewer.

    <p><b><A name="#section 6">Navigating the Viewer Window</b><br></A>
    
    <p>Since the Viewer is one of the most important modules of SCIRun,
    you may want to know more about its functionality.  The User's Guide 
    [link to UG 5.0 Viewer] provides a full description of the Viewer.  
    
    <p> <b>Figure 1.10</b> shows the Viewer window from the
    network you have built earlier in this chapter. In the lower right
    corner of the Viewer's window you will 
    find buttons for controlling the display.  However, the controls you will 
    use most frequently are not visible.
    
    <p><b><A name="section 7">Mouse controls</b><br></A>
    
    <p>The mouse has functionality that works with the Viewer.  To get a
    feel for this functionality:
    <ol>
      <li> Move the mouse to the center of the Viewer window.
      <li> Click and hold the left mouse button. 
      <li> While holding, slide the mouse and objects in the Viewer window
	  shift to follow the mouse movement.   
      <li> Now release the mouse and move it back to the center of the
	  object.
      <LI> Click and hold the middle mouse button and then drag it around;
	  objects in the Viewer will now rotate.
      <li> Release the button and move the mouse to the edge of
	  the objects in the Viewer window.  
      <li> Click, hold, and drag the middle mouse button. The object still
	  rotates but in a different direction from before.  Up and down
	  motions cause the objects to rotate counterclockwise and 
	  clockwise, rather than around a horizontal axis by clicking on
	  the middle of the objects.
    </ol>
    
    <p>To picture the rotation action of the mouse, imagine the objects
    sitting  
    within a sphere. To grab a point on the sphere, click the middle mouse
    button. 
    Moving the mouse drags that point on the sphere around as if the sphere
    were free to rotate but not to shift its position.  By this mechanism,
    the actual movement of the objects 
    depends on the point you click on before moving the mouse. To use an 
    analogy, this is 
    like placing a floating ball in a bowl full of water, touching the ball
    only
    at one point, and then rotating the ball by moving your finger.
	
    <p>Using this type of mouse control, objects can rotate in three
    dimensions  
    while the mouse moves only in two.  With experimentation, you will 
    be able to orient objects in whatever direction you
    wish through simple mouse manipulations.

    <p>For more information, you may consult the User's Guide [link to UG
    5.3].  
    
    <p>Clicking and dragging the right mouse button 
    causes the contents of the Viewer window to get larger and
    smaller.  The creates the impression of moving closer in or
    farther away from the contents of the window <b>(Figure 1.10.1)</b>.

    for the 
    following functions:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Autoview: restores the display back to its default
	  condition; very useful when first viewing an object or when some

      <li>Go home: restores the current home view.  
      <li>Views: lists a number of standard viewing angles and
	  orientations for you to select.
    </ul>
 
    <p>See the User's Guide [link UG 5.0]for more details on these functions.
    
    <p>To access even more display options:
    <ul>
      <li>Locate the "+" button in the lower right corner of the Viewer
	  window.   
	  This button provides access to a more complete set of display
	  options <b>(Figure 1.10.3)</b>. 
	  
      <li>Select features for all objects or for specific objects 
	  in the display through the Extended Control Window[link to UG 5.4
	  ECW].

    <p>Each object has its own list entry in the extended control window.  
    Settings that determine the rendering of each associated object are
    located in the object list. These settings  
    may even turn the entire object on or off,(<i>i.e.</i>, make it appear
    or disappear).   
    
    <p>Default settings apply to all objects that contain the
    "default" selection.  We suggest that you manipulate all of these
    settings to see their possible effects, and consult the
    User's Guide for a more complete description.

    <p><b><A name="section 10">Saving and reloading networks[link to UG
    4.13]</b><br></A> 

    <p>The three-module network that we created earlier provides the
    foundation
    for the nets we create through the rest of this tutorial.  Now we
    will  
    examine how to save nets to disk and reload them in a future SCIRun
    session. 

    <p>To save a SCIRun network (<b>Figure 1.11</b>):
    <ol>
      <li value="1.">Pull down the File menu from the top of the SCIRun window.
      <li>Select &quot;Save&quot;.  
      <li>When the file browser appears, follow the prompt to choose a
	  location and filename for your net (by convention, we keep most
	  nets in the SCIRun/src/nets/ directory, but you can store them in
	  whatever location you wish). 
      <li>For this example, store the net as
	  SCIRun/src/nets/show-torso-mesh.net (we use the .net suffix for
	  SCIRun network files).
    </ol><br> 

    </div>
    <center>
    <p><img height="216" width="320" src="images/figures/1_11.gif"><br>
    <b>Figure 1.11</b></p>
    </center>
    <div align="left">
    <p><br>
    <ol>
      <li value="5.">Now exit SCIRun and restart the program.  
      <li>To load the saved net (<b>Figure 1.12</b>), pull down the
      &quot;Load...&quot; option from the File menu bar.
      <li>Select SCIRun/src/nets/show-torso-mesh.net 
    </ol><br>
    
    </div>
    <center>
    <p><img height="369" width="500" src="images/figures/1_12.gif"><br>
    <b>Figure 1.12</b></p>
    </center>
    <div align="left">
    <p><br>
    </div>
    
    <p>The net should reload into SCIRun, where it was when you saved it.   
    After changing anything in the display (<i>e.g.</i>, rotating the view
    in the Viewer Window or changing
    the rendering color of the nodes in ShowField), then there are
    two options to re-save the net:
    <ul>
      <li>Overwrite the existing show-torso-mesh.net file by simply
	  pulling down File > Save from the menu.  
      <li>Alternatively, save it to a new file using File > Save As...  
    </ul>
    
    <p>For more information on the File menu options (such as Insert and
    Clear), please refer to the User's Guide.
    
    <p><b><H4>Summary</b></H4>
    
    <p>In this chapter, we created a three module network to visualize the
    geometry  
    of a mesh.  We rendered that mesh to the viewing window, and practiced
    saving  
    and reloading networks.

    <p>The next chapter features additional tools to examine data values, 
    and instructions for varying colors over the geometry.
