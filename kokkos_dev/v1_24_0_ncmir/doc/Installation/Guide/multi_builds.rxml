  <title>Single Source, Multiple Binaries</title>
  <para>
    It is possible to build &sr; for multiple machine architectures
    using the same source code directory. For instance, if the
    <filename>&sr;</filename> source code directory resides on a
    shared volume then Linux, 32 bit and 64 bit Irix, and Mac OSX
    versions can be built as follows:
    <literallayout class="monospaced">
mkdir &sr;/linux
mkdir &sr;/irix32
mkdir &sr;/irix64
mkdir &sr;/osx
    </literallayout>
    After logging onto the Linux machine:
    <literallayout class="monospaced">
cd &sr;/linux
../src/configure <replaceable>options</replaceable>
make -j <replaceable>N</replaceable>
    </literallayout>
    Then from the Irix machine(s):
    <literallayout class="monospaced">
cd &sr;/irix32
../src/configure <replaceable>options</replaceable>
make -j <replaceable>N</replaceable>
cd &sr;/irix64
../src/configure --enable-64bit <replaceable>options</replaceable>
make -j <replaceable>N</replaceable>
    </literallayout>
    and the &osx; platform(s):
    <literallayout class="monospaced">
cd &sr;/osx
../src/configure <replaceable>options</replaceable> CC=gcc CXX=g++
make -j <replaceable>N</replaceable>
    </literallayout>
  </para>
