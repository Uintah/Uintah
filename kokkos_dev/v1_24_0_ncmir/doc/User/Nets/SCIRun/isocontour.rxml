<title>Isocontour Net</title>

<section>
<title>Overview</title>

<para>This network (<xref linkend="fig.isocontour-net"/>) uses the
Isosurface module to extract Isocontours from a field.  This network
description will not go into all the functionality of Isosurface, but
rather just enough to help you extract Isocontours from a
field.</para>

<para>Isosurface is used to extract surfaces, and contours from a
field. Go to the 
<ulink url="(%= doc.treeUrl("src/Dataflow/XML/Isosurface.html") %)"> module
description</ulink> for more information about this module's
features.</para>

<section>
<title>Inputs</title> 

<para>We input one of the Fields from the SCIRunData set. In this case
from the sphere dataset we chose the Tetrahedral Volume Field with
data stored as doubles.</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Outputs</title>

<para>The Isosurface module has two outputs, a FieldPort, and a
GeomPort.  In this net we just use the GeomPort.  It outputs scene
graph information much like ShowField, that can be rendered by the
Viewer module.</para>

<section>
<title>Interactions</title>

<para>
The Main interaction involves selecting
which isoval, or collection of isovals that you would like to generate a
contour for.  The notebook tabs at the top give you 3 ways to do so. 
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>The first (Slider) allows you to select a single value, and as
such will only generate a single contour.  The slider lets you select
a value in the range of the min and max value in the field. The entry
lets you enter an exact value directly.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The second (Quantity) allows you to select an evenly spaced set
of isovals.  Note that these are evenly space in data space, not
evenly spaced contours in geometric space.  The user selects the
number of isovals, and a MinMax space to divide, and the Isosurface
module then generate isocontours for each of the evenly spaced
isovals. There are 3 choices for MinMax spacing.  You can base your
evenly spaced set on the min and max values in the data, or from the
min and max specified in the ColorMap (If you pass a color map in), or
you can just specify a min and max value to use.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The third tab (List) allows you to specify a series of isovals
for extracting an isocontour with. The user just enters the list as a
space separated list of numbers, and for each number in the list, an
isocontour is extracted.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
