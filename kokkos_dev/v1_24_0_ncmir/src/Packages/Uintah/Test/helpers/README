Yeah.  Get on europa an do:
echo "/nfs/csafe/cs0/tester/Linux/bin/startTester -j 1 -nomail" | at now

on rapture:
echo "/usr/sci/projects/Uintah/tester/IRIX64/bin/startTester -j 1 -nomail" | at now

The -j 1 tells it to run on 1 processor with no mpi, but I think that's
the default anyway.  With -nomail, it won't send an e-mail to everybody,
but you should still get a cronjob e-mail which has all of the same
information (a little bit more).
