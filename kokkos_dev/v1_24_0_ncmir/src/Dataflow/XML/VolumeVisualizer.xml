    <description>
        <p>The VolumeViewer module implements a volume renderer for
        SCIRun using 3D texture hardware.</p>

        <p> The Basic frame allows the selection of standard
        (Over Operator) or maximum intensity projection (MIP)
        rendering styles.  It also allows for selection of 16 or 32 bit
        blending modes, however in the future this option will be moved to the
        visual selection in the <modref package="SCIRun" name="Viewer"/>.
        There is also a selection for
        Trilinear or Nearest interpolation and a slider for changing the
        opacity of the volume.  Software ColorMap2 Rasterization can be forced
        on in the unusual event that the default rendering mode does not
        work.</p>

        <p> The Sampling frame allows the user to change the sampling
        rate for interactive and non-interactive use.  The number is a
        multiplier and the formula used to compute the actual number of slices
        is "rate * sqrt(nx * nx + ny * ny + nz * nz) / sqrt(3.0)", or
        approximately Sampling Rate slices per texture element.  Adaptive
        sampling refers to the rate at which the volume is sampled while the
        viewer is being interacted with. </p>

        <p> The Shading frame is used to control the lighting
        properties of the volume visualization.  The Shading button toggles
        lighting of the volume's drawn elements and the material is used to
        modulate the lighting color.  This option requires that the texture be
        built with normals.  It also requires a graphics card with
        fragment shader support.</p>
