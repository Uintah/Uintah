    <description>

      <p> Make a LatVolField that fits the source field.  The value type of
the LatVolField is the same as that of the input field.  If
there is no input field specified, then create a unit volume of
doubles.  The size parameters refer to the number of nodes in the
volume, not the number of cells.  Thus a 2x2x2 node lattice will only
contain one cell. </p>

      <p> The Pad Percentage parameter is an optional parameter that
describes how much larger than the input field the resulting lattice
volume should be.  For example, a value of 100 would make the lattice
volume be three times as far across and contain twenty seven times the
volume of a lattice with the default 0 padding.  A value of 50 would
cause the lattice to be twice as far across (50% bigger on each side).
</p>

      <p> No interpolation is done onto the new field.  It is
recommended that the <modref package="SCIRun" name="DirectMapping"/> module be used if those values
are needed. </p>

<title>SampleLattice Regression Test</title>

<p>Create and draw a LatVolField using the SampleLattice module.  The
lattice is not fitted to any input field nor is it transformed so the
output is a box ranging from [-1, -1, -1] to [1, 1, 1].</p>
