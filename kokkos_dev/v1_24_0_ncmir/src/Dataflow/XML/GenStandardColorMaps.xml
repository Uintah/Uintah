    <summary>A module that generates fixed Colormaps for
       visualization tools.
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p>This module is used to create some
         "standard" non-editable colormaps in Dataflow/Uintah.
         Non-editable simply means that the colors cannot be
         interactively manipulated.  The Module does, allow
         for the the resolution of the colormaps to be changed.
         This class sets up the data structures for Colormaps and
         creates a module from which the user can choose from several
         popular colormaps.  By clicking in the Color band the user 
         manipulate the transparency of the color.  This is useful,
         for example, when volume rendering, though many visualization
         tools ignore the transparency data.</p>
      <developer>
	<p>Most of the important work for this module is performed
           in the GenStandardColorMaps.tcl file.  There you can 
           easily add new colormaps by making the obvious changes
           to the buildColorMaps function and the ui function
           (where the make_labeled_radio buttons are created).
           The C++ code merely queries the tcl code and fills
           the Colormap.</p>

      <description>
	<p> Clicking the left mouse button in the color canvas creates a
            node which can be moved to manipulate the opacity
            function. Moving a node to the top of the canvas sets the
            opacity to 1.0.  Moving a node to the bottom of the canvas
            sets the opacity to 0.  Opacity is linearly interpolated
	    between nodes.  Clicking on a node with the right mouse button
	    removes it.
       </p>
	<note> If you happen to move a node off of the canvas so that
               you cannot re-select it, you can close the window and 
               re-open it. Half of the node will appear on the screen
               and the node can be selected.
