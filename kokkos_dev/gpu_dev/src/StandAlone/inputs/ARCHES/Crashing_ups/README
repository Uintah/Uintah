pressure solver not converged, using old values


0 Caught exception: An InternalError exception was thrown (pressure solver is diverging).
Error occurred in file: ../src/CCA/Components/Arches/PressureSolver.cc on line 487.


This ups crashes with the same error regardless of if pressureSolver.cc 
or pressureSolverV2.cc is used.
