      Set a Property for a Nrrd.
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p>Set a Property for a Nrrd.  The property can then be used by
downstream modules to determine various things about the Nrrd.  This
module is only used for editing string properties.</p>

      <p>The properties most commonly set are:</p>

      <p>name:  The name of the Nrrd.</p>
      <p>units:  What units are used when measuring a Nrrd.</p>

      <p>Properties are generally used for domain specific
information, such that the number used in the base SCIRun module set
is quite limited.</p>

      <p>There are also several properties which are not currenty
editable with this module.  These include the multi-value properties
and properties which are not just strings.  These include the minmax
property which is a cache of the min and max values for a Nrrd, and
the conductivities_table which contains conductivities for an indexed
Nrrd.</p>
