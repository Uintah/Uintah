    <summary>
      This function needs an object field that is a volume or a closed surface. 
      When inside the object the distance field is positive, when outside it is 
      negative. The module will fail for not close surfaces as one cannot 
      define inside and outside. Similarly this function will not work for 
      objects that are lines or points. Use the DistanceToField module for these
      objects.
