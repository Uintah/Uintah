<component name="FieldReader" category="DataIO">

    <summary>
    FieldReader allows the user to load-in any of the SCIRun supported Field 
    types and then sends that Field to another module.
    </summary>
    <description>
    <p>Upon opening, the FieldReader GUI defaults to the directory that the user 
    sets for their SCIRUN_DATA environment variable.  Otherwise, the GUI will 
    default to the directory where the user's SCIRun executable resides. The 
    current directory defaults to only show files with an .fld extension which 
    helps the user determine the difference between Fields and other files.  
    However, the FieldReader can read-in a file with any extension so long as 
    the data has the correct format.  If the user attempts to read-in a file 
    that is other than a SCIRun supported Field, or uses an incorrect file 
    format, an error message appears in the Error frame within the SCIRun 
    enrvironment. Clicking the OK button will load the file and dismiss the GUI.
