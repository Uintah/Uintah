    <description>
      <p>
	Given a HexVol of type int (data at cells) as input, send a
HexVol of type int (data still at cells) as output -- the user should be
able to specify a list of "mask-out" datavalues via a GuiVar --
all cells with any of those datavalues should be removed from the
Field, and any nodes that are no longer attached to any cells
should also, obviously, be removed at the end.  The
PropertyManager should be copied from the input field to the
output field as should the remaining fdata values.
