      Compute the derivative of a scalar lattice and output it as a
  vector lattice.
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p>The NodeGradient module computes the derivative of a scalar field
      and converts it to a vector field. The gradient is the
      derivative of three dimensions; the first component in the X
      direction, the second component in the Y direction, and the
      third component in the Z direction grid, computing the general
      direction of "flow" at a specific point on the geometry.</p>

      <p>NodeGradient only supports computation of the gradient on
      node centered LatVolFields of scalar type.  The NodeGradient
      module has no GUI. If NodeGradient recieves as input a Field
      type it does not support, an error message appears in the Error
      frame of the SCIRun environment.</p>
