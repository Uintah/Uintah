    <summary>Cheap histogram-based median filtering</summary>
    <description>
      <p>Cheap histogram-based median filtering. Only works on 1, 2,
or 3 dimensional data. The window over
which filtering is done is always square, and only a simplistic
weighting scheme is available. The filtering works by forming a
histogram of the values in the window, and updating it as the window
slides through the volume. Because of this histogramming, precision
will be lost on anything other than 8-bit data (assuming a sane #
bins). Also, this is "cheap" because it doesn't do any filtering on
the border (as defined by radius). values at these locations are
simply copied from input.
      </p>
      <p>
The filter is applied as if there were always scalars. For example if you have a Vector 
set along the first dimension,
then your Vectors x component is in the first position, y the second,
z the third along the tuple axis. Each component gets the filter
applied independently.
