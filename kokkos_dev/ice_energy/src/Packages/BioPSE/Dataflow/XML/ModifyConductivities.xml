    <summary>Change the conductivity tensors in a field.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        ModifyConductivities is used to interactively change the conductivity
        tensors in a field.  These tensors are then used by many BioPSE
        modules to create the support matrices that are then used to solve
        forward and inverse problems.
      </p>
      <p>
	The tensors are stored as a 'conductivities' property in the
        input and output fields.  The fields should be of integer type
        and contain indices into this conductivities table.  The
        indices start at value zero.  Internally the table consists of
        a vector of entry pairs, each containing the tensor and a
        reference name.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'Tensor Matrix' input port is optional.  If there is an
        Nx9 or 9xN matrix present on that port, then default
        conductivities will be extracted from that matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generating the GUI table can become intractable as the number
        of entries in the table grows.  The default is to not generate
        the GUI table if there are more than 250 entries.  You can force the
        GUI to update anyway by checking the "Force GUI Update"
        button.  It is not recommended that you do so with more than a
        thousand or so entries.
