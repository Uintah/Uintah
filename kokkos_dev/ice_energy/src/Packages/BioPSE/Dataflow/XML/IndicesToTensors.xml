    <summary>Change a Field of ints, into a Field of Tensors.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        IndiciesToTensors is used to convert a Field of ints, where the
        ints are indices into a conductivity_table property (table is
        a vector of pairs, where each pair contains a string (the name
        of the material region) and a Tensor), into a Field of
        Tensors.
      </p>
      <p>
        This module is templatized -- it should work for any Mesh
        type, and any data_at location.  Presently it only work for
        the conductivity_table -- eventually it would be nice to
        instantiate any data type that is mapped through a lookup
        table.
