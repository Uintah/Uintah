CLASS
   TaskGraph
   
   During the TaskGraph compilation, the task graph does its work in
   the createDetailedTasks function.  The first portion is to sort the tasks,
   by add edges between computing tasks and requiring tasks,
   and the second is to create detailed tasks and dependendices.

   Here is a function call tree for this phase:
   createDetailedTasks
     topologicalSort
       setupTaskConnections
         addDependencyEdges
       processTask
         processDependencies
     LoadBalancer::createNeighborhood (this stores the patches that border
                                       patches on the current processor)

   Detailed Task portion: divides up tasks into smaller pieces, and
   sets up the data that need
   to be communicated between processors when the taskgraph executes.

     createDetailedTask (for each task, patch subset, matl subset)

     createDetailedDependencies (public)
       remembercomps
       createDetailedDependencies (private)
         DetailedTasks::possiblyCreateDependency or Task::addInternalDependency

   Then at the and:
     DetailedTasks::compureLocalTasks
