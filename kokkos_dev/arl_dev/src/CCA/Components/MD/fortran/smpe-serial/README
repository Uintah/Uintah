The file "header_list.f90" contains all variables such as atom coordinates, charges etc
The file "allocating.f90" contains subroutine that manage the memory (allocate arrays)
The file "variables_smpe.f90"  contains all variables required for smpe Ewald
The file "slow_fourier_ewald.f90" contains a subroutine that compute Ewald sumation in a slow way (no smpe)
The "main.f90" is the main code.

Files that contains other unrelated to smpe things such as input output or math operations:
c_functions.c
math.f90
IO_module.f90 (subroutine to read write data)
random_generator.f90  (subroutine wit hrandom generator)
periodic_boundary.f90 (compute the distance between atoms subject to periodic boundary conditions)

----
The important files that are actually related to smpe: 
fft-3d.f90 - does a 3D Fourier transform; these are from dl-poly program; they are the fastest fft addapted for SERIAL molecular dynamics
spline2.f90 - contains subroutine that show how to compute the spline functions in real and complex space
smpe_utility_pack.f90 - subroutines that actually does the smpe operations
smpe_driver.f90 - the main driver subroutine that does smpe; mostly call subroutines from smpe_utility_pack.f90
 Folloowing what is in subroutine "smpe_Q" from the file "smpe_driver.f90" one can see the required instructions to do smpe

input files:
in.in : the required parameters 
1) i_type_EWALD_CTRL = 1 (for smpe Ewald) or 2 (for slow (non-smpe) Ewald)
2) nfftx,nffty,nfftz : The grid points to compute the reqular grid charge. Typicall 1 point / Angstom. Must be 2^n
3) order splines along xx yy zz directions  for smpe : could be 4, 6 or 8
4) k_max_x,k_max_y,k_max_z : The k vectors for slow Ewald ; could be any positive inveger. 

config.small or config.large: The actual coordinates of atoms;
NOTE: after reading the config I randomize it a bit to make sure I won;t get zero due to symmetry.

----------

To run smpe one needs the grid points nfftx,nffty,nfftz and the order of spline functions
The Ewald spliting parameter alpha = 0.25d0 and for now it is hard coded; let's keep it for a while unchanged.

---

The file "slow_fourier_ewald.f90" contains a subroutine which evaluate Ewald in classical (slow) way as in Lucretius. 
It could be used to validate smpe.
