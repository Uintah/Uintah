<h1>VIEWMESH</h1>

<b>Description:</b><p>

Display an unstructured mesh.<p>

Edges in the mesh are displayed as lines.  Some infrastructure has
been created for cylinders, but these are effectively unimplemented.
Lines look nice and are fast, so cylinders aren't really necessary.
<p>

The module takes a .htvol file as input (unstructured rtrt format).
