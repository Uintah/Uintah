----------

This package contains much of the code I used for my thesis 
(Isosurface Extraction in Time-varying Fields, Univerity of Utah).
The concentration is on octree-based isosurface extraction, done in 
several different ways.  For more information on the branch-on-need
octree, see Wilhelms & van Gelder's 1992 paper in ACM ToG.

The "Packages/Phil" package contains the standard GUI/ and Modules/ directories.
The modules contained in this package are:

Isosurface extraction modules:
Bono		The basic branch-on-need octree implementation for 
		isosurface extraction in a rectilinear scalar field.

BonoP		A parallel version of the BONO algorithm.

BonoCL		A version of the BONO for curvilinear grids.

Tbon		An implementation of the T-BON algorithm for 
		isosurface extraction in rectilinear scalar fields.

TbonP		A parallel version of the T-BON algorithm.

TbonCL		A curvilinear version of the T-BON algorithm.

TbonUG		A version of the T-BON for unstructured grids.

TbonOOC1	An out-of-core isosurface extraction algorithm
		based on the T-BON

TbonOOC2	Another out-of-core isosurface extraction algorithm
		based on the T-BON

Other modules:
ViewGrid	Displays a representation of the regular or curvilinear grid.

ViewMesh	Displays a representation of the unstructured mesh.

ElapsedTime	A useful little module - displays a running clock of elapsed
		time.

More information for each module can be found in the HTML documentation
(Packages/Phil/Dataflow/Modules/Tbon/doc/index.html).
