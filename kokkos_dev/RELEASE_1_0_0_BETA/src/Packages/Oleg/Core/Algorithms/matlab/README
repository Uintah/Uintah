This directory contains a test for SCIRun communication library
AT PRESENT, THIS WORKS ONLY IF MATLAB SIDE IS ON RAPTURE

bring.c     : base communication routine
transport.c : matlab communication routine
cmp.m       : script to compile (from matlab environment)
              converts transport.c -> transport.mexsg64

The following file may be there already (may be not):
transport.mexsg64 : pre-compiled sgi matlab executable
                    (calls from matlab environment as a function)

sciruntst.m : actual test to run.

tst.uin     : matching script file for SCIRun
inp.mat     : input matrix for tst.uin

The SCIRun test reads matrix from the disk, 
sends it to matlab,
where it is multiplied by two, 
returned back, 
and SCIRun saves it to other file.

 
To run the test, matlab side should be on rapture
and SCIRun side anywhere.
Place all the files located in this directory (where README is) 
in the test directories on respective hosts.

Then:

1) run matlab (on rapture)
2) from matlab, run script cmp to compile
3) check that transport.mexsg64 is produced without errors
4) in file sciruntst.m, very first line, change host:port 
   to where SCIRun will be running  
5) run sciruntst.m 

6) execute SCIRun (assuming that sandbox "Oleg" is commited)
7) open script tst.uin
8) in the gui of first MatrixSend module check host:port where
   matlab is running (rapture:5505)
9) in the gui of MatrixSave, point to output file (say, res.mat, ascii)
10) in the gui of MatrixRead, point to input file (inp.mat)
11) execute first module.

12) Check that inp.mat*2=res.mat


Both sides run as clients, that is they are manually
controlled. If you want to repeat the test, BOTH tst.uin and
sciruntst.m have to be run again.
