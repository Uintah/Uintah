    <p>
      Core/Util is a miscellaneous collection of code.  The code can be
      classified into 3 groups: debugging tools, timing routines, and
      SCIRun internal code.
    </p>
    <p>The debugging tools and timing routines are generally useful.  The
      SCIRun internal code is not.
    </p>
    <p>The SCIRun internal code consists of routines for accessing shared
      libraries and work arounds of bugs on Linux platforms.
    </p>
  </fit>
  <use>
    <when>
      <p>Use the the debugging and timing tools when developing any kind of code.</p>
    </when>
    <why>
      <p>
	Use the debugging tools to specify data invariants, catch
	programming errors, and log messages during program execution.
      </p>
      <p>
	The timer tools can be used to analyze code bottlenecks and perform
	other timing tasks.
      </p>

    <term>
      Assertion
    </term>
    <p>
      Assertions have 2 (related) uses.  They are used to catch programming
      errors and they may used to make promises between a routine
      and its caller, i.e. "If you the caller send me data that does not
      violate my assertion(s) then I, the routine, promise to do the
      right thing by you." 
    </p>
    <p>
      Assertions express a set of valid states a data object (or objects)
      may possess at some point in the code.  If a piece of data is not in
      a valid state, i.e. it violates the assertion, then the assertion
      will catch this violation, report the violation, and perhaps terminate
      the program.
    </p>
  </definition>
  <example>
    <p>
      SCIRun supports a number of assertion styles which can be found in
      Assert.h and FancyAssert.h.  Here are a few examples:
    </p>
    <p>
      Ensure that the variable 'n' is greater than 0:
    </p>
    <code>
      ASSERT(n > 0);
    </code>
    <p>
      Ensure that 'a' is equal to 999:
    </p>
    <code>
      ASSERTEQ(a, 999);
    </code>
    <p>
      Other examples:
    </p>
    <code>
      ASSERTNE(a, 0);
      ASSERTRANGE(a, 0.0, 1.0);
    </code>
  </example>

      Timer
    </term>
    <p>
      A Timer keeps track of time.  Class Timer is an abstract base class -
      you can't create a Timer object.  But you can create objects of the
      derived types CPUTimer, WallClockTimer, and TimeThrottle.  These all
      provide the functions start(), stop(), clear(), time(), and add().  A
      TimeThrottle also provides the function wait_for_time().  Functions
      common to all timers are:
    </p>
    <p>
      start() starts or resumes a timer.
    </p>
    <p>
      stop() stops a timer.  It does not clear accumulated time.  The timer
      may be resumed with start().
    </p>
    <p>
      clear() sets the timer's accumulated time to 0.  clear() may be executed
      while a timer is running (although a warning will be written to std error).
    </p>
    <p>
      time() returns the timer's accumulated time.  It may be executed
      while the timer is running or stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      add(double t) adds t seconds to the current elapsed time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Individual timer types are discussed next.
    </p>
  </definition>

    <term>
      CPUTimer
    </term>
    <p>
      CPUTimer records the elasped CPU time (seconds) used by the calling
      process (including system CPU time used on behalf of the calling
      process).
    </p>
  </definition>
  <example>
    <p>
      Sample use of a CPUTimer:
    </p>
    <code>
      CPUTimer cpuTimer;
      cpuTimer.start();
      for (i =0; i<3; ++i) {
        .
        .
        .
      }
      cpuTimer.stop();
      cout << "Loop used " << cpuTimer.time()
           << " seconds of cpu" << endl;
    </code>
  </example>
  <definition>
    <term>
      WallClockTimer
    </term>
    <p>
      WallClockTimer records elasped real time (seconds).
    </p>
  </definition>
  <example>
    <p>
      Sample use of a WallClockTimer:
    </p>
    <code>
      WallClockTimer wcTimer;
      wcTimer.start();
      for (i =0; i<3; ++i) {
        .
        .
        .
      }
      wcTimer.stop();
      cout << "Loop used " << wcTimer.time()
           << " seconds of real time" << endl;
    </code>
  </example>
  <definition>
    <term>
      TimeThrottle
    </term>
    <p>
      TimeThrottle is a WallClockTimer with the added function wait_for_time().
    </p>
    <p>
      wait_for_time(double endtime) will suspend the calling thread until
      the given endtime (seconds) has elapsed.  This function is only
      implemented on SGI systems.
    </p>
  </definition>
  <example>
    <p>
      Sample use of a TimeThrottle:
    </p>
    <code>
      TimeThrottle timeThrottle;
      timeThrottle.start();
      double startTime = timeThrottle.time();
      // Start doing stuff.
      .
      .
      .
      // Make sure that not less than 1 second has elapsed since we started
      // doing stuff.
      timeThrottle.wait_for_time(startTime + 1);
    </code>
  </example>
