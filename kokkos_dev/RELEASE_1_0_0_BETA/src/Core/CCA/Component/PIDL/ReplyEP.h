DESCRIPTION
   Class to provide efficient access to a transient endpoint, typically
   used for a reply.  The static methods acquire and release are used
   to obtain a ReplyEP for use in a reply.  The wait() method blocks
   until the reply has been sent to the reply handler (handler number
   0), and returns the nexus buffer.
