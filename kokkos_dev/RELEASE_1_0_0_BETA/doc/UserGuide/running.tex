\section{Starting Up}
\label{sec:startingup}

\subsection{The \command{scirun} Command}
\label{sec:sciruncmd}

Start \sr\ by typing \keyboard{scirun} in a terminal (\eg \command{xterm})
window.  Don't start \sr\ in the background, \ie don't type
\keyboard{scirun \&}.

The \command{scirun} command is located in the \directory{src} directory of
the \directory{\sr} install directory.  The person who installed \sr\ can
locate this command for you.

Typing \keyboard{scirun} with no arguments starts up \sr\ with a blank \sr
window as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:srwindow}.  The main features of this
window are discussed in \secref{Anatomy of the Main
  Window}{sec:windowanatomy}.

The \command{scirun} command may take 1 argument which is the name of a
\sr\ \dfn{network} \index{network} file (these files have a \filename{.net}
extension).  These files hold previously defined \sr\ networks.  \sr\ will
load the specified network.  Network files will be discussed in a later
section.

\sr\ may encounter errors during start up.  These will be displayed in \sr{}'s
error message pane (see Figure~\ref{fig:srwindow}).  \AuthorNote{Need to
  add refs to bug reporting here.}

\subsubsection{Anatomy of the Main Window}
\label{sec:windowanatomy}

The \sr\ main window consists of 4 main components (see Figure~\ref{fig:srwindow}):

\end{figure}

\begin{description}
\item[Menu Bar] The menu bar is used to load networks, save networks, quit
  \sr, create network modules, and perform other tasks.  The menu bar
  consists of the following menu items:

  \begin{description}
  \item[\menu{File}] 
    \begin{description}
    \item[Save] Saves the current network to a file.
    \item[Load] Loads a network from a file.
    \item[New] This submenu contains items of interest to developers only.
    \item[Add Info] Use this item to add network specific notes to
      the current network.  Notes should be used to document the purpose of
      the network.
    \item[Quit] Quits \sr.
    \end{description}
  \end{description}
  
  \begin{description}
  \item[\menu{SCIRun}] The \menu{SCIRun} menu is used to create modules
    (from the \sr\ package) for use in the network pane.  This menu is
    composed of submenus. Each submenu corresponds to a \dfn{category}
    \index{category} within the \sr\ package. 
    
    An overview of the contents of the \sr\ package is given in \secref{The
      SCIRun Package}{sec:srpackage}.

    Each menu item in a category submenu creates a specific module and
    places it in the network pane.  A category is group of related modules.
    
    The network pane's popup menu (activated by clicking the right most
    mouse button when the mouse pointer is in the network pane) also
    provides access to the \menu{SCIRun} (and possibly other) package
    menus.
  \end{description}

  \begin{description}
  \item [\textit{Possibly Other Package Menus}] There may be other package
    menus if other packages have been installed.
  \end{description}

\item[Navigator Pane] The Navigator Pane is used to navigate complex
  networks.  The Network Pane's scroll bars can also be used for network
  navigation.  The use of the Navigator Pane will be described in
  \secref{Building Networks}{sec:bldnetworks}.
  
\item[Error Pane] Errors during program startup are displayed in the Error
  Pane.  Errors on startup may mean that \sr\ has been installed
  incorrectly or has been installed from a buggy distribution.
  
\item[Network Pane] The Network Pane is used to build and execute networks.
  \secref{Building Networks}{sec:workwithnets} discusses the use of this
  pane.

\end{description}

\subsection{The Terminal Window App}
\label{sec:termwinapp}

After starting, \sr\ will also run a shell-like application in the terminal
window.  It will display the prompt \screen{uintah\ra}.  This program is
actually a modified \dfna{Tool Command Language}{TCL} shell program and it
is possible to type in \acronym{TCL}'ish \sr\ commands at the prompt. The
use of this program will be discribed in a later section.


\subsection{\envvar{SCIRUN\_DATA}}
\label{sec:scirundata}

The environment variable \envvar{SCIRUN\_DATA} affects the behavior of \sr\ 
It specifies the default location of \sr\ data files.  It mainly affects
the behavior of file browsing dialogs -- they will prompt for a file within
the \envvar{SCIRUN\_DATA} directory (of course you may have the dialog look
elsewhere).


\subsection{Stopping}
\label{sec:stopping}

Quit \sr\ by selecting the \menuitem{Quit} item from the \menu{File} menu

Don't press \keyboard{Ctrl-c} to exit \sr.  Doing this will drop you into
a debugger which is probably not what you want to do.
