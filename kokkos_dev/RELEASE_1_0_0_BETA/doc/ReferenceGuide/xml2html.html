<h2>
Converting <i>yourspec</i>.xml to <i>yourspec</i>.html</h2>
The following uses xalan from apache and requires that you have java installed.
<p>your CLASSPATH needs to contain the following:
<blockquote>
<li>
/usr/local/contrib/mcole/java:</li>

<li>
/usr/local/contrib/mcole/java/bsf.jar:</li>

<li>
/usr/local/contrib/mcole/java/bsfengines.jar:</li>

<li>
/usr/local/contrib/mcole/java/xalan.jar:</li>

<li>
/usr/local/contrib/mcole/java/xerces.jar</li>
</blockquote>
Your PATH&nbsp;must include your java bin for me it looks like this: /usr/java/bin
<p>Then do the following:
<blockquote><b>cd /usr/local/contrib/mcole/java/Transform</b>
<br><b>java Transform yourspec.xml spec.xsl > yourspec.html</b></blockquote>
<b>spec.xsl</b> does a <font color="#663300">very basic translation</font>,
nicer ones are sure to follow...
