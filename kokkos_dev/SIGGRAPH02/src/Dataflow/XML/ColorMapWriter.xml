    <summary>Save persistent representation of a colormap to a file.
    </summary>
    <description><p>Upon opening, the ColorMapWriter GUI defaults to the directory that the user sets for their SCIRUN_DATA environment variable.   Otherwise, the GUI will default to the directory where the user's SCIRun executable resides. The user can enter the name of a file that the matrix saves to. The file should have a .cmap extension. The default file name is MyColorMap.  The user may choose to save the file in either Binary or ASCII file format.</p>
