  CLASS
     SpChannel
   
  DESCRIPTION
     The base class for all communication-specific startpoint 
     channel abstractions. A startpoint channel is a client
     channel in the sense that it binds to a particular server
     based on the server's url. The channel abstraction itself
     is meant to establish the connection and provide methods
     in relation to it. The communication sends and recieves are
     performed by the message class.
