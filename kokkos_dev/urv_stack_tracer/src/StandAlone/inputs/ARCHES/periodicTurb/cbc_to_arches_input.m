% cbc_to_arches_input: reads the cbc_uvw data and generates data that is
% proper for Arches to initialize.
% The cbc_uvw dataset represents an
% initial condition for isotropic turbulence that fits the cbc 
% (Comte-Bellot & Corrsin) experimental spectrum. This data was generated
% using a two-step process:
% 1. Generate random phases and fit them to the cbc spectrum
% 2. Since the random data does not satisfy mass conservation, it is run
% through a single timestep subject to Navier-Stokes physics
% 3. Compute the energy spectrum of the velocity field after a single
% timestep and inject some energy into those modes that showed energy
% decay. Note that at this stage the velocity will gain some divergence but
% it is of the order 10^-3.
%
% For more information on this procedure, see Rnady McDermott's dissertation.

% The cbc_uvw data may be found on the FDS code website:
