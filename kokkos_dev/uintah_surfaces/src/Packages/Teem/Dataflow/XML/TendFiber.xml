    <description>
      <p>Extract a single fiber tract, given a start point. Currently,
only fibers based on 4th-order Runge-Kutta on principal eigenvector are
supported via tend. The world space in which fibers are calculated has the
volume inscribed in a bi-unit cubecentered at the origin. The output fiber is
in the form of a 3xN array of doubles, with N points along fiber. </p>
      <p>Step Size : stepsize along fiber, in world space. This value should be a double.</p>
      <p>Stopping Criteria : the conditions that should signify the end of a fiber.
      Multiple stopping criteria are logically OR-ed and tested
      at every point along the fiber. These conditions include Fiber Length, Number of Steps,
      Confidence Threshold, and Anisotropy Threshold.</p>
      <p>Kernel : Kernel for reconstructing tensor field.</p>
