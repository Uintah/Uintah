Third Party Installation README
-------------------------------

Version Numbering
-----------------

The SCIRun Thirdparty software tarball changes much more slowly then
SCIRun itself.  However, to make things as straightforward as possible
and to avoid confusion, the version number of the Thirdparty is
updated to match the version number for the release of SCIRun.  Actual
changes to the Thirdparty will be listed in the SCIRun release notes
for each release.

Necessary Tools
---------------

Python 1.5.2 (or later) and GNU make (3.79 or later) must be present
before running the third party installation script.

The simplest execution of the script only requires a single argument:

  python install dir

where "dir" is the directory under which the third-party software will be
installed. See "NOTE" below for an explanation and example of how the
final path to installed libraries is created.

There are additional optional arguments like so:

  python install dir bits jobs

"bits" must be one of 32 or 64, and refers to the bit size of 
binaries, and "jobs" is the number of processes that will be used to 
compile the libraries.

  python install /usr/local/SCIRun/Third_Party 64 2

or 

  python install /usr/local/SCIRun/Third_Party 32 1

When finished, the installation script will display the complete name
of the third-party software installation directory---make note of this
value (and see "NOTE" below).

-- Reinstalling all or part of the required Thirdparty software --

You may reinstall part or all of the third-party software by repeating
your install command line exactly. The script will see that a previous
installation exists at the specified location, at which point you will 
be asked to replace all or part of the installation. Just answer 
'y' or 'n' as the script asks you which tarballs to reinstall. For
each target that you said 'y' to, the previous installation will be
deleted, and a fresh one installed.

-- Installation path and its meaning --

NOTE: The name of the third-party installation directory reflects the
parameters given to the install script. This allows you to maintain
multiple third-party installations for different operating systems and
machine architectures. for example on a Mandrake 9.0 linux machine:

  python install /usr/local/SCIRun/Thirdparty

will create the installation under:

  /usr/local/SCIRun/Thirdparty/1.8/Linux/gcc-3.2-32bit

{specified path}/{tp version}/{platform}/{compiler and specified size}
