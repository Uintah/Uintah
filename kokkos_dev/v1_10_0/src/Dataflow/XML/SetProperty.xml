      Set a Property for a Field (or for its mesh).
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p>Set a Property for a Field or Mesh.  The property can then be
      used by downstream modules to determine various things about
      the field.  This module is only used for editing string
      properties.</p>

      <p>The properties most commonly set are:</p>

      <p>name:  The name of the field or mesh.</p>
      <p>units:  What units are used when measuring a mesh.</p>

      <p>Properties are generally used for domain specific
      information, such that the number used in the base SCIRun module
      set is quite limited.</p>

      <p>There are also several properties which are not currenty
      editable with this module.  These include the multi-value
      properties and properties which are not just strings.  These
      include the minmax property which is a cache of the min and max
      values for a field, and the conductivities_table which contains
      conductivities for an indexed field.</p>
