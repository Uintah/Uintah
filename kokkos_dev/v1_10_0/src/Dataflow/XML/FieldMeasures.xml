    <summary>
        Build a densematrix, where each row is a particular
        measure of the input Field (e.g. the x-values, or the element
	size).
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        FieldMeasures outputs a NxM matrix filled with values
	associated with the input mesh measures at selected mesh locations.
      </p>
      <p>
	First the user selects the measues location in the top half of
	the UI.  The number of measure locations equals the number
	of rows (N) in the output matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
	Then the user selects what measures are sampled at each
	location in the bottom half of the UI.  The number of measures
	selected equals the number of columns (M) in the output
	matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
	Description of Measures:
      </p>
      <p>	
	X position - The X coordinate of the center of the measure
	location.
      </p>
      <p>	
	Y position - The Z coordinate of the center of the measure
	location.
      </p>
      <p>	
	Z position - The Z coordinate of the center of the measure
	location.
      </p>
      <p>	
	Index - The index used by the code to reference the measure
	location.
      </p>
      <p>
	Valence - The # of similar measure locations that share a
	connection with the measure location.  This varies by mesh and
	is not defned in all circumstances and thus equals 0 in these
	cases.
      </p>
      <p>	
	Size - The Euclidean Volume of the measure element.  Ex:
	length for edges or  0.0 for points.
