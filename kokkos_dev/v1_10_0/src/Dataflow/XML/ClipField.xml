    <summary>Select a subset of a field.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
        This module clips out a subset of a field.  The new field
        contains just the selected portion of the input field.
      </p>
      <p>

        The module runs in one of three different modes.  If a field
	is connected to the "Clip Field" port, the module will clip
	the input field such that only those elements inside of the
	clip field are preserved.  If Functional Clipping is turned
	on, then the function specified in the GUI is used to
	determine which elements are inside of the field.  Finally, if
	no Clip Field is connected and functional clipping is turned
	off then the GUI widget is used to select which portion of the
	input field to preserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The type of the field is preserved in the clip, as well as the
        data values if possible.  Some field types are structured and
        thus not clippable.  This includes the LatVolField, ImageField,
        and Scanline field types.  There is an Unstructure module that
        can be used to convert these fields to appropriately
        unstructured versions before clipping.
      </p>
      <p>

        The function specified by the functional clipping mode is
	evaluated as a TCL expression.  $x is the variable used for
	the value in the field.  For example, "$x == 0 || $x == 1"
	will select all of the elements where the data value is equal
	to 0 or 1.
