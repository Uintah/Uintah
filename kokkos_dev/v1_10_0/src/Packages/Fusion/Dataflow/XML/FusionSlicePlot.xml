<p>The Fusion Slice Plot is really a super module which combines
the following modules ManageFieldData, LinAlgUnary, ManageFieldData,
MapDataToMeshCoord, and another ManageFieldData. </p>

<p>The height field is data values are normalize from 0 to 1 with
field being offset in the direction of plane normal. </p>
