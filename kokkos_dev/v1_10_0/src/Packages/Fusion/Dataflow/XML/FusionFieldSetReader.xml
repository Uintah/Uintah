    <summary>
Read in a series of mds files and output a single NrrdData with a time
axis of size equal to the number of files read.
    </summary>
      <description>
	<p>
Using the browser from the UI button, select the first file in the
series. All subsequently numerated files in that directory will be
read and added to the time axis.
      </p>
	<p> The Fusion Field Reader reads an ASCII file and output the
following fields of data stored in a NrrdData. Pressure, Temperature,
Magnetic, Velosity. The format of the data uses a keyword token
followed by zero or more values and is as follows: </p> 
	<p> Type (token = NIMROD)</p>
	<p> Time (token = TIME value)</p>
	<p> Field layout (token = FIELDS 'number of fields' 'field
descriptor' ...)</p>
	<p> Dimensions and end condition (token = DIMENSIONS token =
REPEATED or SINGULAR dim dim dim) </p>

	<p> The field descriptors may be in any order but the grid
should be first followed by the data. The descriptors may as follows:
GRID_R_Z_PHI, BFIELD_R_Z_PHI, VFIELD_R_Z_PHI, PRESSURE, TEMPERATURE.
With vector data the field may in X-Y-Z, R-Z-PHI, or R-PHI-Z.</p>
