    <summary>Given all the information stored about the input nrrd
output a field of the appropriate type.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
          If a Field is stored in the NrrdData, and the nrrd data
still maps to the Mesh in that Field, create a new Field sharing the
original Mesh. Otherwise for three dimensional nrrd data create a
LatVolField, for two dimensional nrrd data create an ImageField, and
for one dimensional data create a ScanlineField. The created field is
the output for this module. 
      </p>
      <p>
         All NrrdData have Nrrd's created with a tuple axis, so that
multiple sets of data can be joined and stored in the Nrrd.
NrrdToField always will take te first data set along that tuple axis.
If you have a Nrrd that has multiple sets in it, and you want to
convert a particular element of the tuple, use NrrdSlice to select the
tuple element prior to this module.

	<p>Run the test network (see examplesr tag), and verify that
geometry and data values are identical.  This can be done with visual
inspection. Just turn off and on display of nodes to compare
colors.</p>
