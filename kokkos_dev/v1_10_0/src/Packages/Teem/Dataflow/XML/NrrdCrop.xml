    <summary>Create an output nrrd that is a subsample of the
original.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>Crop preserves dimension.  To get valid values in the gui the
module must execute.  After first execution, the user interface has
correct values, and will perform a crop that produces the identical
nrrd as was input. The min and max pairs per axis in the user
interface are the sample indecies that you wish to crop.</p>
      <p>The tuple axis has logical indecies that represent the whole
labeled chunk of data along the axis. Look at the example network.
It's  input has 2 data sets along the tuple axis, gradients (Vector
type), and potentials (Scalar type). Using NrrdInfo you can verify
this.  In the NrrdCrop user interface index 0 corresponds to the
gradients Vector data set, and index 1 corresponds to the Scalar set
named potentials.</p>
