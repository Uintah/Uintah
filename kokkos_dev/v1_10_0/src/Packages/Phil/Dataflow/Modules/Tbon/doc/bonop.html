<h1>BONOP</h1>

<b>Description:</b><p>

<a href="template.html">Template class</a> (Please read!)<p>

Parallel implementation of the Branch-on-Need Octree (BONO) for 
isosurface extraction in rectilinear scalar fields (see Wilhelms 
& van Gelder's 1992 ACM ToG paper for details).<p>

Some preprocessing must be done before isosurface extraction (once per 
data set, same preprocessing as for the BONO module).  Run the module 
using a preprocessing metafile if this has not already been done.<p>

During execution (run the module on an execution metafile), the
user controls isovalue and time value sliders.  Data set is read
in whenever the time value changes, left in memory when only isovalue
changes.  A Marching Cubes-type interpolation is performed to 
create triangles for rendering.<p>

A centralized work queue model is used to distribute computation.
First, the tree and data for the current time step are read into memory.
Then, the tree is traversed and all cells containing portions of the
isosurface are enqueued.  Threads then request jobs and are given
batches of cells on which to perform interpolation and triangle 
construction. <p>

The number of worker threads is hard coded.  This is because I didn't
want to deal with recreating the work queue and forking more threads
whenever the user changed
the "# processors" slider.  So if you want to change it, just look in
BonoP.cc for "np = " and change that number.<p>

<p><b>Metafile format:</b><p>

Same as for the <a href="bono.html#metafiles">BONO</a> module.<p>
