This directory contains a widely used test case for verifying your turbulence model. The case consists of a isotropic-turbulence initial conditions that decay over time. The initial conditions correspond to periodic grids of sizes 32x32x32 and 64x64x64, respectively. These are provided by the files:

cbc32_uvw_wasatch_u.gz
cbc32_uvw_wasatch_v.gz
cbc32_uvw_wasatch_w.gz

cbc64_uvw_wasatch_u.gz
cbc64_uvw_wasatch_v.gz
cbc64_uvw_wasatch_w.gz

The cbc terminology is in honor of the original experiment by Comte-Bellot and Corrsin in which they generated grid turbulence and extracted plenty of statistics including energy spectra.

This directory also contains a collection of matlab scripts that will help you postprocess your data by calculating the energy spectrum given (u,v,w) data generated by Wasatch (or other uintah components).

In general, you will only need to work with the function energy_spectrum_plot_all. All other matlab scripts include helper functions that are used by energy_spectrum_plot_all. To use this energy_spectrum_plot_all, follow these steps:

1. Run your turbulent flow simulation

2. Use lineextract to save your u, v, and w velocities at t = 0.0s, t = 0.28s, and t= 0.66s as these correspond to the experimental datapoints

3. With lineextract, save your output as: 
    uvel/vvel/wvel_basename_t0.28s/t0.66s.txt
    for example: vvel_32_wasatch_csmag_t0.28s.txt is the lineextract for the y-velocity field. here, the basename is 32_wasatch_csmag.

4. Execute energy_spectrum_plot_all(output_filename,base_name, figure_title). 
Here, the output_filename designates the pdf filename of the exported figure, base_name denotes the base_name in the lineextract output filename, and figure_title is a string that corresponds to the figure's title. For example, energy_spectrum_plot_all('ke_wasatch_wale_32','32_wasatch_wale','Wale model, C_w = 0.7') will look for lineextract files with names:
uvel_32_wasatch_wale_t0.28s.txt
vvel_32_wasatch_wale_t0.28s.txt
wvel_32_wasatch_wale_t0.28s.txt
uvel_32_wasatch_wale_t0.66s.txt
vvel_32_wasatch_wale_t0.66s.txt
wvel_32_wasatch_wale_t0.66s.txt
The output pdf figure will have the title ke_wasatch_wale_32.pdf and will have the title: Wale model, C_w = 0.7.
