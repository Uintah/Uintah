 *  @class  StateTable
 *  @author James C. Sutherland
 *  @date   December, 2005
 *
 *  @brief Support for B-Splined tables, with I/O in HDF5 format.
 *
 *  The table is structured, with arbitrary order interpolation provided by the
 *  underlying B-Spline representation of the data.  In the case where an
 *  unstructured dataset is available, it must be approximated (rather than
 *  interpolated) on a structured table.
 *
 *  Clustering the grid is acceptable, but the grid metrics cannot be functions
 *  of any other independent variable.
 *
 *  The reason for this restriction is primarily related to performance.
 *  Multidimensional unstructured interpolation is expensive and complicated.
 *  We want to avoid that mess altogether.
