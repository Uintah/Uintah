    <summary>Graph anisotropy metric in barycentric coords. The
metrics all vary from 0.0 to 1.0, and will be sampled in the lower
right half of the image. The plane on which they are sampled is a
surface of constant trace.

      <p>Graph anisotropy metric in barycentric coords. The metrics
all vary from 0.0 to 1.0, and will be sampled in the lower right half
of the image. The plane on which they are sampled is a surface of
constant trace.</p>
      <p>Resolution : resolution of anisotropy plot. This value should
be an integer.</p>
      <p>Sample Whole Triangle of Constant Trace : check to sample the
whole triangle of constant trace, instead of just the sixth of it in
which the eigenvalues have the traditional sorted order.</p>
      <p>Set Outside Pixel Values to NaN : set the pixel values
outside the triangle to be NaN. If not checked they will be set to
0.</p>
      <p>Anisotropy Metric to Plot : Which anisotropy metric to plot.
All the Westin metrics come in two versions. Currently supported: cl1,
cl2: Westin's linear; cp1, cp2: Westin's planar; ca1, ca2: Westin's
linear + planar; cs1, cs2: Westin's spherical (1-ca); ct1, ct2: GK's
anisotropy type (cp/ca); ra: Basser/Pierpaoli relative anisotropy; fa:
Basser/Pierpaoli fractional anisotropy/sqrt(2); vf: volume fraction =
1-(Basser/Pierpaoli volume ratio); tr: trace.</p>
