 * DESCRIPTION     : Provides ability to read and get information about
 *                   a set of Analyze files.  The read function can read
 *                   one valid Analyze series at a time.  The other functions
 *                   return information about what Analyze series' are in a 
 *                   directory and what files are in each series.  The user
 *                   can use that information to decide which directory/files
 *                   to read from.  The read function stores each Analyze 
 *                   series as a AnalyzeImage object, which in turn contains 
 *                   information about the series (dimensions, pixel spacing, 
 *                   etc.).
 *
