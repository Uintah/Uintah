#   moveToCursor window
#
#   Author: J. Davison de St. Germain
#
#
#   Moves the given "window" to near the cursor location.  It also
#   withdraws the window.  This is because it needs to determine the
#   size of the window for proper positioning of the window near the
#   edges of the screen.  If you want the window to be remapped, 
#   set the _optional_ parameter to "leave_up":
#
#   moveToCursor $w "leave_up"
#
#   or use the default version
#
#   moveToCursor $w
#

set screenWidth [winfo screenwidth .]
set screenHeight [winfo screenheight .]

  # If we are currently running a script... ie, we are loading the net
  # from a file, then do not move GUI to the mouse.

  # After fixing BioPSEFilebox.tcl, I need to at least thank Samsonov
  # because his comments did clue me in on how to get the width and
  # height of a widget.  You have to "withdraw" it first and call
  # "update idletasks" to make it figure out its geometry ... so now
  # this will work!
