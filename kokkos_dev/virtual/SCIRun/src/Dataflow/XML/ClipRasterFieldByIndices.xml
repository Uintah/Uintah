The Field Sub Sample module sub samples a structured grid. It is
posible to sub sample a particular region or sparsely sample the grid.

      <title>ClipRasterFieldByIndices Regression Test</title>

      <p>Read in the utah torso model and display it's boundary for
reference. Then resample the model using the SampleLattice module to
fit it to a regular grid which is then visualized as a point cloud.
Finally the ClipRasterFieldByIndices module is used to select a sublattice from
the sampled lattice.  This sublattice is then drawn using larger dots
and compared with the underlying mesh to determine that it was
selected correctly.</p>
