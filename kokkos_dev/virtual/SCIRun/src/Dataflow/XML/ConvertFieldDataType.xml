of mesh (TetVolField, LatVolField, TriSurfField, etc.) as well as the
type of the data (unsigned char, double, Vector, Tensor, etc.).

      <p>Here we convert the input from a field of doubles to a field
of short integers.  Because the original field ranges from around -6.0
to 5.0, we first scale the data values such that they fall between 0
and 255. Otherwise the output field would be mostly truncated to
integers between -6 and 4.</p>

      <p>Note that the scale and data type change could be handled by
the TransformData module by selecting 'Short' as the output type and
using a function that first converted the data values to the desired
range.</p>

      <p>See also <modref package="SCIRun" name="TransformData"/>,
<modref package="SCIRun" name="TransformData2"/>, <modref
package="SCIRun" name="TransformData3"/>.</p>
