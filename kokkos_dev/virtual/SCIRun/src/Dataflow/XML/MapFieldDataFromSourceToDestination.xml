    <summary>The MapFieldDataFromSourceToDestination module takes two Fields as input, the
first of which, Source, contains geometry and data values; the second,
Destination, contains geometry only. MapFieldDataFromSourceToDestination takes a field and
finds data values for the destination geometry and outputs the
resulting Field.</summary>

      <p>SamplePlane is used to place a cutting plane through the utah
torso model, and then the voltage values from the torso field are
interpolated onto this cutting plane.  The field boundary is also
displayed for reference.</p>
