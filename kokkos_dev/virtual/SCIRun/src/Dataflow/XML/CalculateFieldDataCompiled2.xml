      <title>CalculateFieldDataCompiled2 Regression Test</title>

      <p>Demonstrate usage of the CalculateFieldDataCompiled2 module.  First a
cyclone data set is created by resampling a LatVolField onto a
PointCloud and then using <modref package="SCIRun"
name="TransformData"/> to assign vectors to that PointCloud using a
cylindrical mapping.  A scalar field containing the x position of each
point in the PointCloud is also created.  The two PointCloudField data
sets are then merged using TransformData by recreating a vector for
each point in the PointCloud that contains the direction of the input
vector field and the magnitude of the input scalar field. Finally this
merged field is visualized using <modref package="SCIRun"
name="ShowField"/>.</p>
