	  <p>The port takes a handle to the matrix that is n-by-6 in size,
	  containing parameters of n dipoles (the first three column are dipole
	  positions, the other three are dipole moments). We also assume that the dipoles
	  lie inside the sphere. Otherwise, the moudle log window produces a warning message.</p>
