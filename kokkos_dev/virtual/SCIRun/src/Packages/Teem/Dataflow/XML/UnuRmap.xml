    <summary>Map nrrd through *regular* univariate map (colormap). A
map is regular if the control points are evenly spaced along the
domain, and hence their position isn't explicitly represented in the
map; the axis min, axis max, and number of points determine their
location. The map can be a 1D nrrd (for grayscale), in which case the
output has the same dimension as the input, or a 2D nrrd (for color),
in which case the output has one more dimension than the input. In
either case, the output is the result of linearly interpolating
between map points, either scalar values (grayscale), or scanlines
along axis 0 (color).
