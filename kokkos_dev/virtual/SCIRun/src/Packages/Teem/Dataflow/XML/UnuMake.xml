    <summary>Create a nrrd (or nrrd header) from scratch. The data can
be in one or more files, or coming from stdin. This provides an easy
way of providing the bare minimum information about some data so as to
wrap it in a nrrd, either to pass on for further unu processing, or to
save to disk. However, with -h , this creates only a detached nrrd
header file, without ever reading or writing data. When reading
multiple files, each file must contain the data for one slice along
the slowest axis. Nearly all the options below refer to the finished
nrrd resulting from joining all the slices together, with the
exception of -ls , -bs , and -e , which apply to every input slice
file. When reading data from many seperate files, it may be easier to
put their filenames in a response file; there can be one or more
filenames per line of the response file.</summary>
