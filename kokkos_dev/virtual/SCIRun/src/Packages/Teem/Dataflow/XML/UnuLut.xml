    <summary>Map nrrd through univariate lookup table (itself
represented as a nrrd). The lookup table can be 1D, in which case the
output has the same dimension as the input, or 2D, in which case the
output has one more dimension than the input, and each value is mapped
to a scanline (along axis 0) from the lookup table.</summary>
