    <summary>
      Map nrrd through *regular* univariate map (colormap). A map is
regular if the control points are evenly spaced along the domain, and
hence their position isn't explicitly represented in the map; the axis
min, axis max, and number of points determine their location.  This is
an N dimensional mapping in that the fast axis of the nrrd is used to
look up coordinates in the N or N+1 map.  If the map is of dimension N
then it is assumed to be grayscale, otherwise all of the fast axis is
treated as a 'color'.  This module does no interpolation, rather the
nrrd coordinates should exactly match the range of the colormap nrrd
dimensions, ie 0-255 for a 1D map of size 256.
