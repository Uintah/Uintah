This directory contains a library of Matlab functions developed
at the SCI institute, which are provided to extend the basic Matlab
functions with code which helps in Biological Simulation Applications
and with the integration into SCIRun.

The functions in this library are organized in directories which correspond
to different projects being pursued at the SCI institute.

The functions present in the main directory are used for adding all the
variables to Matlab's workspace needed
