GLEW does not compile GLX support on OSX by default.  We set an
environment variable in the install script to make it always compile
that way.

GLEW has -L/usr/X11R6/lib hardcoded as the X11 library path.  On some
64 bit linuxes this should be -L/usr/X11R6/lib64, and should probably
be -L/usr/X11R6/lib32 on 32 bit builds for 64 bit linuxes.  We work
around this hardcoding by patching in an extra GLEW_LDFLAGS_EXTRA
variable to config/Makefile.linux that can be overridden from the
installation script.
