CLASS
   HypreSolverBase
   
   A generic Hypre solver driver.

KEYWORDS
   HypreDriver, HypreSolverParams.

DESCRIPTION
   Class HypreSolverBase is a base class for Hypre solvers. It uses the
   generic HypreDriver and fetches only the data it can work with (either
   Struct, SStruct, or 

   preconditioners. It does not know about the internal Hypre interfaces
   like Struct and SStruct. Instead, it uses the generic HypreDriver
   and newSolver to determine the specific Hypre
   interface and solver, based on the parameters in HypreSolverParams.
   The solver is called through the solve() function. This is also the
   task-scheduled function in AMRSolver::scheduleSolve() that is
   activated by Components/ICE/impICE.cc.
  
WARNING
   solve() is a generic function for all Types, but this may need to change
   in the future. Currently only CC is implemented for the pressure solver
   in implicit [AMR] ICE.
