ExecTimes         SCI_DEBUG     outputs the time for execution on each task.
                                To view the top 10 tasks use:
                                sort -t: -k 2 -k 3 -g -r exectimes.?.? | head
                                To get a summary of all exectimes files run the script src/scripts/execsummary

AMR               SCI_DEBUG     prints out the patch layout
AMR_CoarsenRefine SCI_DEBUG     prints out debugging information for coarsening and refining operations
TaskDBG           SCI_DEBUG     output the name of each task as it begins executing and when it's completed
TaskLevel         SCI_DEBUG     output the task name and beginning patch on each level after the 
                                task has completed.
TaskGraph         SCI_DEBUG     prints out computes and requires for every task
TaskGraphDetailed SCI_DEBUG     prints out internal details of computes and requires for every task
WaitForDebugger   SCI_DEBUG     when an exception is thrown halt the program and print out
                                the pid so you can attach a debugger to it.
OnDemandDataWarehouse           outputs when a variable is retrieved or put into the data warehouse.
VarLabel                        List when a VarLabel is created and deleted

ThreadedMPI       SCI_DEBUG     Use ThreadedMPIScheduler - Multi-threaded with centralized control thread
ThreadedMPI2      SCI_DEBUG     Use ThreadedMPI2Scheduler - Multi-threaded with no control thread
GPU               SCI_DEBUG     Multi-threaded with GPU support, centralized control thread

ICE_BC_CC         SCI_DEBUG     output boundary condition debugging information for
                                Cell-centered variables.                         
ICE_BC_FC         SCI_DEBUG     output boundary condition debugging information for
                                Face-centered variables. 
DBG_EqPress       SCI_DEBUG     Output debugging information about the iteration
                                process in computeEquilibration if an exception is thrown.
