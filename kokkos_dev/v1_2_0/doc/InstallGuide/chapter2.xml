  <title>SCIRun Installation and Build Instructions</title>

    <para>
      This chapter provides detailed instructions for installing and
      building SCIRun and it's packages.

  <sect1>
    <title>Prerequisites</title>
    <para>
      Use of this document requires experience with the SGI
      Irix operating system and/or the Linux operating system.
      Knowledge of file systems, programming in C/C++, building
      software from tarball distributions and shell scripting will
      be useful if not required.  The installation or upgrade of
      core system components (such as the OS and compilers) may be
      required.  As such, a system administrator's assistance may
      be warranted.

    <title>Minimum System Software Requirements</title>

    <para>
      SCIRun is officially compatible with two platforms: SGI and Linux.

      The following table describes the minimum system software
      requirements for SCIRun.  Other versions may also work, but are not
      officially compatible.

            SCIRun can be installed into any directory, within a user 
            home directory or a system application directory. There is
            no "make install" step in the build process, so SCIRun
            will be installed in the chosen directory.

          <para>
            There are many options for configuring SCIRun with location 
            as the chief option.  SCIRun can be configured from within
            the <term>INSTALL_DIR</term>/SCIRun/src 
            directory, as is commonly done, which yields the following:
          </para>
     
          <sect2>
            <para>
              <term>BUILD_DIR</term> = <term>INSTALL_DIR</term>/SCIRun/src
            </para>
          </sect2>

          <para>
            However, SCIRun can also be configured from locations other 
            than the source directory which allows for having multiple
            builds for different platforms, or for for different ABI's
            (Applications Binary Interface) while still sharing a single 
            source directory: 
          </para>

          <computeroutput>
cd <term>INSTALL_DIR</term>/SCIRun
mkdir linux
mkdir sgi32
mkdir sgi64
cd linux
../src/configure <term>CONFIGURE_OPTIONS</term>
cd ../sgi32
../src/configure <term>CONFIGURE_OPTIONS</term>
cd ../sgi64
../src/configure --enable-64bit <term>CONFIGURE_OPTIONS</term>
          </computeroutput>

          <para>
            In addition to the configure location, there are several 
            options that may be invoked at configure time by supplying
            the configure command with arguments. The available
            <term>CONFIGURE_OPTIONS</term> can be found in the 
            <ulink url="installguide.xml?dir=2&amp;cont=4">Appendix</ulink>

          <para>
            To run GNU make, simply type "make" or "gmake", depending
            on how the command for GNU make is spelled on the target
            install machine:
          </para>

cd <term>BUILD_DIR</term>
gmake

          <para>
            Just like configure, GNU make has some useful options.  The 
            "number of jobs" option, is the most commonly used option
            for building SCIRun : 
          </para>
   
          <computeroutput>
gmake -j <term>NUM_JOBS</term>
          </computeroutput>
    
          <para>
            Where <term>NUM_JOBS</term> is an integer. If the target
            install machine has multiple processors, setting
            <term>NUM_JOBS</term> to the number of processors
            available uses all the processors to build SCIRun 
            in parallel, often significantly speeding up the time to
            build SCIRun. 
          </para>

    <title>Running SCIRun</title>
    <para>
      After a successful build, there will be an executable in
      the <term>BUILD_DIR</term> directory named "scirun".  Running
      this will open the SCIRun network editor window and start a
      console (called the SCIRun console) in the shell where scirun
      was started from. 
    </para>   
    <para>
      If the window does not appear, note any errors
      displayed in the SCIRun console and see the getting
      help section below.  Of course, it might just be
      hiding behind other windows on the desktop!
