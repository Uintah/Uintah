\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


This is the \etitle{\srug}.  It describes the purpose and use of the \sr{}
problem solving environment.  It is for those users who will be building
and executing \dfn{networks} within the \sr{} environment.

Those who will be installing \sr{} should read the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{\srig{}}{\installguideurl}.

\subsection{Road Map}
\label{sec:roadmap}

This document is organized into the following main sections:

\begin{description}
  \item \secref{Introduction}{sec:intro} is what you are reading now.
  \item \secref{Concepts}{sec:concepts} introduces the concept of an
        integrated problem solving environment  and describes how \SR{}
        embodies some of these ideas.
  \item \secref{Starting \sr}{sec:startingup}  outlines the procedure for
        starting \sr{} and related information.
  \item \secref{Working with Networks}{sec:workwithnets} discusses tasks
        involved in building, editing, and executing networks.
  \item \secref{Visualization with the \viewer{}}{sec:viewer} describes the
        purpose and use of a visualization module called the \viewer{}.  The
        \viewer{} is probably \sr{}'s most commonly used module.
  \item \secref{Packages}{sec:packages} offers an overview of the content
        of the \sr{} and \pse{} packages (which provide nearly all of
        \sr{}'s computational services).
  \item \secref{Importing data into \sr{}}{sec:import} summarize ways to
        get data in your local format into and out of \SR{}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Getting Help}
\label{sec:help}

Help is available from several sources.

\subsubsection{In the Distribution}

documents are also in the distribution's \directory{doc} directory.

\subsubsection{On the Web}

This and other documents related to \sr{} can be found in the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{document}{\scidocurl{}} section of the

Be sure to visit the main \sci{} web site for lots of other
information related to \sr{} and the \scii{}.

\subsubsection{From the Mailing Lists}

The \sr{} users mail list is a forum for discussing \sr{} related issues.
To subscribe send mail to:

\mailto{Majordomo@cs.utah.edu}

with the following command in the body of your message:

\keyboard{subscribe scirun-users}

\subsection{Reporting Bugs}
\label{sec:bugs}

Please report bugs!  To report a bug visit \sr{}'s
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{bug database}{\bugsurl} web page.

Reporting bugs this way (rather than by way of the mailing list) ensures
that they will be fixed in timely manner.
