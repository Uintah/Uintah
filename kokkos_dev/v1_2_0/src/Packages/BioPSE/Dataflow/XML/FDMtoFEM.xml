    <summary>Change a finite difference model into a finite element
    model</summary>

      <p>Version: 1.1</p>
      <p>Given a finite difference model as input (conductivity
      tensors at cell centers on a LatticeVol), build a finite
      element model that represents the same system.  The finite
      element model is a TetVol of ints, where the ints are indices
      into a lookup table of conductivity tensors stored in the
      PropertManager.</p>
