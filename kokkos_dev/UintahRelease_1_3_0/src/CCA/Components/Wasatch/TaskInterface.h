   *  \author James C. Sutherland
   *  \date   June, 2010
   *
   *  \brief Provides an interface to Uintah
   *
   *  The TaskInterface class provides an interface to Uintah for the
   *  ExpressionTree and Expression objects.  Each time this task is
   *  executed, the fields and operators are re-bound on all of the
   *  expressions.  This is because one ExpressionTree (and hence
   *  Uintah::Task) may be executed on multiple patches (data).
   *  Therefore, we must re-bind these to the data specific to the
   *  patch that they are being executed on.  Alternatively, a unique
   *  tree and set of expressions could be constructed for each
   *  patch. This would require more memory, however.
   *
   *  \todo for tree cleaving, we need to put MODIFIES flags on fields
   *        rather than COMPUTES or REQUIRES.  This might be a bit sticky.
