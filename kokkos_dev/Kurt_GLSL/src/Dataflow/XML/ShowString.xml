    <description>
      <p>This module is able to display multiple lines of information in the 
      viewer window. The module takes a string as input and displays the
      contents on top of the viewer window. If there are 'newlines' in the
      string multiple lines are displayed (up to ten lines). In the GUI the
      font size and color can be altered as well as the location of where to
      plot the text. This module is intended to provide the user with a means
      to put any arbitrary information about the data being shown on the
      display.</p>
