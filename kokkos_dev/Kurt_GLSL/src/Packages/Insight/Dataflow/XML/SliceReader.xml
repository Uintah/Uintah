    <description>

    <p>Read in a 3D volume a slice at a time.  Slicing is done along
    the last axis.  This module currently only works for the case of
    an Analyze header file (.hdr) and Analyze image file (.img). The
    basename of these files must be the same and the image file cannot
    be compressed. If Cast Output is checked, the output image will
    be cast to a float image.</p>
