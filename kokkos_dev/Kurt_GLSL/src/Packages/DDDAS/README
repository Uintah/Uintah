DESCRIPTION
-----------

See the 'DESCRIPTION' field in the header of source code file 
DDDAS/Dataflow/Modules/DataIO/StreamReader.cc .


USAGE
-----

- Start SCIRun

> cd [build directory]
> ./scirun

- Load the StreamReader network
  - File -> Load
  - Browse to src/Packages/DDDAS/nets/SampleStreamReader.net
  - This should bring up the net.
  - Pull up the UI for the StreamReader module.
  - Fill in the desired values for hostname, port number, and mp3 file to read.
    The 'Save As' field allows you to specify a file where the stream output 
    should be written to as ascii.  You can look at this file to see what data 
    was read.    
  - Click 'Execute'
  - At this point you should see data printed out in the terminal you're
    running in.  If the connection to the stream failed, an error message is 
    printed out.  Otherwise, information about data read from the stream is 
    printed.  
  - To stop the module, click 'Stop'.  To restart it, click 'Execute'.  Do not 
    click 'Execute' when the module is already executing. 


ORGANIZATION
------------

Currently, all of the code for reading and processing the test sensor 
data streams is
located in the file DDDAS/Dataflow/Modules/DataIO/StreamReader.cc .  The GUI
code is located in DDDAS/Dataflow/GUI/StreamReader.tcl.  This is 
the code for a SCIRun module called StreamReader.  StreamReader is capable of 
reading data from test sensor streams 1 and 2, but the code for sensor stream 1
has been removed and exists only in older cvs versions.  It may or may not be 
worthwhile to move this code into separate modules for each type of data that 
is read and processed from a stream. 

Within StreamReader.cc there are generalized functions for connecting to a 
stream and there are generalized reading and processing functions that look 
for recognized headers in stream data and pass the data to the appropriate 
specific reading and processing functions for each different stream format.  

There are two threads in the code, one for reading data from the stream and one
for processing the data.  The threading can be turned on or off using the 
#define THREAD_ENABLED near the top of StreamReader.cc.

Some helper code, including socket code, is contained in DDDAS/Core.


KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

The two threads occasionally livelock.  Specifically, the reader thread locks 
out the processing thread.  I've put in a sleep statement in the reader thread 
to temporarily prevent livelock until I get around to fixing this. 


NOTES
-----

Other related files including a development log and a verification script can 
be found in the cvs checkout of dddas under dddas/SCIRun/docs and dddas/SCIRun/verification, respectively.


RUNNING ENVIRONMENT
-------------------

I've developed all the SCIRun DDDAS package code with this platform/hardware:

Redhat 9.0 Linux 
Intel Pentium 4 2.2 GHz processor
Nvidia Quadro4 video card
1 GB RAM
