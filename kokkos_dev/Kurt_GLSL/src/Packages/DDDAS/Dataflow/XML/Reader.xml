    <summary>Produce LatVol from solution points.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>Continuously reads a series of .out mesh files from a
specified directory (hard-coded) and produces a LatVol representation
of each set of solution points generated by the AggieFEM/ccfv code.
There are 64000 cell-centered solution points in the image,
represented as a structured grid.  Each set of solution points
represents one time step.</p>
