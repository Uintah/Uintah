      Release Notes (Brief) for SCIRun Version 1.24.0b<br/>February 3, 2005 
    </h1>

    <a id="begin-toc">Contents:H1,H2</a>

    <h1>New Projects in Version 1.24.0b</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>New BioImage PowerApp and tutorial. BioImage is a PowerApp
      for visualizing regular, three dimensional scalar volumes, such
      as MRI and CT datasets.  BioImage supports input datasets in
      DICOM, Analyze, NRRD, VFF, PICT, VOL, and SCIRun (Field)
      formats.  BioImage offers combined 2D and 3D visualization
      options.  The 2D views are axis-aligned (axial, sagittal,
      coronal), and support setting the window/level, color-mapping,
      pan/zoom, and three display modes: slice, maximum intensity
      projection (MIP), and slab.  The 3D visualization support
      includes direct volume rendering, a technique for seeing
      specific features of interest within a volume.  Users can paint
      colored brush strokes over features of interest in the 2D views,
      and the corresponding volume features will be interactively
      updated and displayed in the 3D view.

      <li>High-performance Direct Volume Rendering.  We have
          dramatically improved our volume rendering algorithms in
          SCIRun.  With this release, we now offer support for
          interactive visualization of high-resolution volumes (up to
          512 x 512 x 512), using the latest graphics card technology.
          Our volume rendering algorithms support normal-based
          shading, as well as depth cueing, and user-specified
          sampling rates (for controlling the level of accuracy and
          interactivity in the rendering).  Our volume rendering
          algorithm also supports multi-dimensional transfer
          functions, which gives the user increased specificity when
          identifying features of interest (especially
          boundaries).</li>

      <li>New ViewSlicer 2D rendering module.  This module supports
          the interactive rendering of slices from a 3D volume.  As
          described above, axis-aligned planes can be interactively
          selected, windowed/leveled, color-mapped, and rendered.
          This module provides the 2D viewing window of the BioImage
          PowerApp.</li>

      <li>Added support for 64 bit linux builds.  We have run preliminary
          tests of SCIRun on 64 bit Altix and Gentoo linux.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Platform specific installation guides</li>
      <li>Tutorial for BioImage PowerApp</li>
      <li>Tutorial for FusionViewer PowerApp</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Network Editor Enhancements</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added an experimental SCIRUN_NO_PORT_CACHING environment
      variable.  This should allow SCIRun to work on larger data
      sets.</li>

      <li>Added Bundle support.  Allows multiple data pipes to be
          combined into a single pipe.  (Can help de-clutter canvas.)</li>
    </ul>
