// The idea of a dynamically compiling class is the following:
//  A general pointer to the Field is given to the algorithm, this is a pointer
//  to the base class of the Field which is the same for all possible Field 
//  types. To discover what type it is a virtual function call into the Field is
//  made revealing its true identity. This type information is used to compile
//  a templated algorithm that uses the specific field type as a template 
//  argument. When the algorithm is compiled it will execute the algorithm.
//
// In this file two classes are defined:
//  A base class ToPointCloudAlgo: This class contains the general access point for
//  the dynamic compiled algorithm. It takes handles (pointers) to the Field
//  base class. It will examine all the input arguments and determine which
//  type the input Fields actually are. When this is known it will tell the
//  dynamic compiler which algorithm needs to be compiled to carry out the 
//  operation with high efficiency.
//
//  A template class ToPointCloudAlgoT: This class is derived from the base class
//  and has a similar call to the algorithm. This templated class contains the 
//  actual algorithm. When the dynamic compiler is invoked it will take in a
//  handle to the base algorithm, internally it will overload this with the
//  handle to the templated algorithm. Since the templated class will overload
//  the access function calling this one from the base class will get us to the
//  proper algorithm.  


// ToPointCloudAlgo:
//
// This class is the general access point to the dynamic algorithms in the class.
// All dynamic algorithms in the class are defined as virtual functions and have
// the following form:
//  virtual bool MyFunction(ProgressReporter* pr, FieldHandle input1, 
//                                FieldHandle input2, ... FieldHandle& output) 
//
// If the algorithm fails it returns false, if it succeeded it return true.
//
// In order to forward the error message all dynamic algorithms take in a 
// pointer to the current ProgressReporter. The ProgressReporter reports 
// everything from the progress the algorithm made, to errors, remarks, warnings
// and is the general access point to forward messages to the user.
//
// To call this specific algorithm from a module use the following:
//
// ToPointCloudAlgo algo;
// if(!(algo->ToPointCloud(this,input,output)))
// {
//   // algorothm failed
// }
//
// Note that the module class has been derived from the ProgressReporter and 
// hence the pointer to the module can be used to initialise the ProgressReporter
//

// ToPointCloudAlgoT:
//
// This class is the actual implementation of the algorithm. Note that the 
// name of the algorithm ends with a 'T' to denote that the algorithm is 
// templated, this is not strictly needed but improves readability if the code.
// This templated class can overloads the algorithm access point with the 
// proper algorithm.
