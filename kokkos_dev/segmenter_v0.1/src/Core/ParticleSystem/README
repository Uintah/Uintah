			NEWTONIAN PARTICLE SYSTEM

A particle simulation involves three main parts: particle themselves, emitters that emit thses particles and the entities that apply forces to particles.

Particles have mass, position, velocity and are subjected to forces. There can be additional attributes attached to each particle (age, life span, color, etc.)

Emitters are objects that emit particles from a particular position in some direction. Emitters can be arbitrarily shaped (ie. a point emitter) and emit particles at some rate.

All particles are subjects to forces. Forces are grouped in three basic categories:
- unary forces such as gravity and drag that act independently on each particle
- n-ary forcs such as springs that apply forces to a fixed set of particles
- forces of spatial interaction such as attraction and repulsion. They may act on any or all pairs of particles depending on their position.

The basic algorithm for any particle system is the following:

Loop over time (at given time step dTime):

	1. Emit all particles at given time step
	2. For each particle
		- set force acting on a particle to 0
		- compute all forces acting on a particle
		- compute velocity and acceleration
		- update position and velocity 
	3. Update state
	4. Update time



The main program would therefore look like:

	Create some emitters
	Create forces
	Create a particle system
	Add forces and emitters to the particle system
	Loop over time
		particleSystem->Update()



TODO: 

	Collision detection
	Taking into accoun the age of particles (ie they die when they
        are old and are removed from the system)
