Benchmark Cases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the benchmark cases has gradients in the solution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\cdot q$
\end_inset

 and all but one of the cases has spatial gradients in at least one field
 property.
 The four benchmark cases are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Benchmark 1: Burns and Christon
\series medium
.
 This case is described by Burns and Christon (Burns 1997).
 The case describes a three dimensional cube 1m in length, with a constant
 temperature and a tri-linearly varying absorption coefficient depicted
 in figure !!!.  Walls are cold and black.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Benchmark2: Michael Modest black parallel plates.
 
\series default
This case is described by Modest in section 13 of his Radiation Heat Transfer
 book (Modest 2003).
 A gray, non-scattering medium with refractive index n=1 is contained between
 two infinitely parallel, gray plates.
 The medium is isothermal at temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{m}$
\end_inset

, with constant absorption coefficient, 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

.
 The two plates are both isothermal at temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{w}$
\end_inset

, have the same gray-diffuse emissivity 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

, and are spaced a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 apart.
 For this problem, a known analytical solution exists for the radiative
 heat flux as well as the radiative flux divergence.
 The analytical solution for the flux divergence is as follows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dq}{d\tau}=\sigma(T_{w}^{4}-T_{m}^{4})*\frac{-2[E_{2}(\tau)+E_{2}(\tau_{L}-\tau)]}{1+(1/\epsilon-1)[1-2E_{3}(\tau_{L})]},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{3}$
\end_inset

 are exponential functions, defined as follows
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{n}(\tau)=\intop_{0}^{1}\mu^{n-2}e^{-\tau/\mu}d\mu,
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $cos(\theta).$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See Modest figure 13.2 for the general behavior of the exponential functions.
 This case was used with the following values: 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=1,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{L}=1,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{w}=1000K,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{m}=1500K,$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L=1$
\end_inset

m.
 To model the infinite parallel plates, the four side walls were specified
 with emissivities of 0, such that they had no emissive contribution, and
 they allowed the rays to reflect specularly.
 The two remaining walls had an emissivity of 1.
  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found that this case required a greater number of rays to achieve comparable
 accuracy to the Burns and Christon benchmark.
 This is due to the fact that a ray striking a reflective wall gives a drastical
ly different result than a ray striking the black plate.
 Therefore the angular discritization, which is a function of ray number,
 plays a more important role.
 A ray-convergence plot is given in Fig.

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Benchmark 3: Modified Burns and Christon.
 
\series default
This case is has the same properties of the Burns and Christon case with
 one modification--rather than a constant temperature throughout the domain,
 the temperature was set as follows
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T=1000abskg
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $abskg$
\end_inset

 is the absorption coefficient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Benchmark 4: Modified Modest.
 
\series default
This case is similar to the Michael Modest case, but with the following
 two changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
abskg(z)=(\frac{z}{L})^{2},
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T=1000+1000abskg,
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is the vertical coordinate, and L is the length of the domain.
 Therefore the absorption coefficient changes from 0 to 1 quadratically,
 and temperature varies from 1000K to 2000K quadratically.

 Note that the grid convergence levels off for resolutions greater than
 approximately 100^3 cells.
 For resolutions finer than this, the grid error is negligible relative
 to the ray error, which for this case is approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-2.7}$
\end_inset

.
 Also note the shallow slope of convergence even for coarse resolutions.
 Because the properties of the media do not vary in space, only items 1
 and 4 from the theory come into play in grid convergence.

 Because this case is based on benchmark 1, which is a symmetric case, we
 know that the ray error is relatively low, and that the ray convergence
 rate can be approximated by figure

 Therefore, there is an increase in accuracy with higher resolutions up

L2 norm of error scaled by

 for benchmark 4.
 Because the result of ray striking a reflective surface is so different
 from the result of a ray striking a black plate is so drastically different,
 the ray error is quite high even for large numbers of rays (100,000 in
 this case).
 This is demonstrated by the fact that there is no increase in accuracy
 beyond even 
\begin_inset Formula $9^{3}$

 cells.
