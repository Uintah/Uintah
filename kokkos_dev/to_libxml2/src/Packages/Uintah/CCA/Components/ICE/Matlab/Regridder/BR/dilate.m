function b = dilate(a,n)
%CASCSDE Dilate a binary image of flagged cells.
%   B = DILATE(A) returns a "dilated image" of A (a convlution with a filter
%       that determines the local connections. We use a 5-point filter in 2D, 7-point in 3D).
%       This represents one "safety layer" on the binary array A of flagged cells.
%   B = DILATE(A,N) dilates N times (N safety layers).
