      This module is intended to replace GatherFields and fix a number of problems
      associate with the old module.

      <p>
      This module takes in an arbitrary number of input fields and
      gathers them all up into one output field.  If the input
      fields all have the same editable mesh type then the output
      field will also be of the same type.  If the meshes are not
      editable or of different mesh types then only their points
      will be gathered up and a single PointCloudField will be
      produced.
      </p>

      <p>
      The module has the option to merge nodes together when they are at the
      same physical location. Often due to numeric round off, they are at a 
      slightly different position. Hence the module allows to set a tolerance
      which is used to determine whether two nodes are in fact the same. The 
      tolerance is a simple measure in distance that is applied to see whether
      nodes are the same.
