    <summary>The MatrixWriter modules saves a persistent representation of a matrix to disk.</summary>
    <description><p>Upon opening, the MatrixWriter GUI defaults to the directory that the user sets for their SCIRUN_DATA environment variable.   Otherwise, the GUI will default to the directory where the user's SCIRun executable resides. The user can enter the name of a file that the matrix saves to. The file should have a .mat extension.  The default file name is MyMatrix.  The user may also choose between a Binary or ASCII file format.  The Split check box option splits the reader file and matrix data into two files.
