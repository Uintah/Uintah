    <description>
      <p>Extract a single fiber tract, given a start point. Currently,
only fibers based on 4th-order Runge-Kutta on principal eigenvector
are supported via tend. The world space in which fibers are calculated
has the volume inscribed in a bi-unit cubecentered at the origin. The
output fiber is in the form of a 3xN array of doubles, with N points
along fiber. </p>
      <p>Step Size : stepsize along fiber, in world space. This value
should be a double.</p>
      <p>Stopping Criteria : the conditions that should signify the
end of a fiber. Multiple stopping criteria are logically OR-ed and
tested at every point along the fiber. These conditions include Fiber
Length, Number of Steps, Confidence Threshold, and Anisotropy
Threshold.</p>
      <p>Kernel : Kernel for reconstructing tensor field.</p>
