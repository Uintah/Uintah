# Configuration file for the publish.rb script.
#
# This file is really a Ruby Hash using Ruby hash syntax:
#   <key> => <value>
# where <key> is a string and <value> is <key>'s associated value.
# The type of <value> is commonly a string although Ruby boolean, IO,
# and Array type values occur as well.  In one instance a sub-type of Hash
# is used (the Dest type).
#
# Below, many settings, though somewhat typical, must be changed to be useful.

# Path of directory containing the SCIRun tree.
# Default: "."  
# Note that ruby variable buildDir is set as a side effect of setting
# the hash value buildDir because buildDir is used later in this file.
