Release Notes - SCIRun Version 1.10 - Apr 23, 2003

Future Plans
------------

After this release of SCIRun (version 1.10), the SCI Institute will
begin work on a major new upgrade.  This will be the upgrade of SCIRun
to version 2.0 and will include separating the GUI from the SCIRun
compute engine, adding macro-module support to the GUI, allowing
scripting (and thus batch mode runs and easier regression testing),
and better Boundary Element method support.  We anticipate the release
of SCIRun 2.0 in late August.

Macintosh support: Preliminary work has been done to port SCIRun to
the Macintosh resulting in the ability to run SCIRun on a Macintosh
here at SCI; however there are still a number of issues that must be
addressed.  In the near future (early May, '03), the Mac will become
an officially supported platform.  Updates to SCIRun version 1.10 will
be provided to those interested in running SCIRun on a Mac.

Data Sets
---------

The only differences between the SCIRunData directory from release
1.8.0 to release 1.10.0 are the new "convert-examples" and
"time-dependent" subdirectories.  The "convert-examples" show how to
use the new SCIRun data conversion process to convert generic data to
SCIRun data (please see the "New Converters" section later in this
document).  The "time-dependent" directory contains new examples of
time dependent data.

If you already have the 1.8.0 SCIRunData directory, you can update it
to version 1.10.0 by downloading SCIRunData.1.8-to-1.10-update.tar.gz
and untaring it on top of the 1.8 directory.  


New Projects in Version 1.10
----------------------------

- Support for constructing and processing segmented data volumes and
  their dual (the Separating Surfaces).  This update is part of the
  BioPSE package; most of these modules are in the BioPSE::Modeling
  category.

  - SegLatVolField can be built from a LatVolField by passing it into
    the SegFieldOps module

  - SegLatVolField can be turned back into a LatVolField with
    SegFieldToLatVol module.

  - SegLatVolField can be turned into a set of Separating Surfaces
    (SepSurf) using the ExtractSepSurf module.

  - An individual QuadSurf component can be extracted from a
    SegLatVolField with the ExtractSingleSurface module

  - SepSurf can be turned into a normal QuadSurfField via the
    SepSurfToQuadSurf module

- Support for Masked meshes and fields and for Quadratic basis
  functions.

- Support for hexahedral finite elements (finite differences are
  currently under development): Hexahedral finite elements with linear
  basis functions can be used to solve the Poisson equation. In order
  to employ these finite elements, the computational domain should be
  discretized using a 'HexVolMesh'. Each finite element can have a
  tensor, representing material properties. Note: Within this release,
  only parallelepiped hexahedral elements are supported.

- Support for analytic anisotropic concentric sphere solutions: A
  four-layer anisotropic concentric spherical volume conductor is
  available which computes a dipole-induced potential on the outer
  sphere surface. Each of the four spherical layers can have different
  radial and tangential conductivities.  See:  Minor Net Descriptions:
  Sphere.

- Support for PETSc (See PETSc Installation in the Installation Guide).

- Preliminary support for TriSurf and TetVol mesh refinement via
  bisection, node insertion, and Watson-style node insertion

- Three new inverse-problem modules are now available in the
  BioPSE/Inverse category: Tikhonov, TikhonovSVD, and TSVD.  These
  implement Tikhonov inversion with flexible control of 
  regularization, Tikhonov inversion via singular value decomposition,
  and matrix inversion via truncated singular value decomposition,
  respectively.

- Two time-dependent EEG datasets (scalp electrode recordings), and
  one time-dependent ECG dataset (epicardial sock recordings) for
  users interested in time-dependent problems have been added.  These
  datasets are available in the new SCIRunData/time-dependent
  subdirectory, and are used in the BioPSE show-eeg-data and
  tikhonov-inversion nets, respectively.

- A complete set of StandAlone "converter" programs to enable users to
  import their datasets into SCIRun, and to export SCIRun datasets to
  their systems have been added.  These are described in more detail
  in the "New Converters" section below.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Modules  (SCIRun, unless noted otherwise.)
-----------

- ChangeCoordinates: move between Cartesian, Polar, Euclidean, and
  Range coordinates.

- ConfigureWireElectrode (BioPSE): turns a non-bifurcating CurveField
  into a QuadSurf by inflating it by a specified radius and specifying
  a constant voltage over the surface.

- HexToTet: convert a HexVolField into a TetVolField by splitting
  each hex into five tets.

- IndicesToTensors (BioPSE) and TensorsToIndices (BioPSE): converts
  between Fields that store their Tensors in lookup tables (Field<int>
  and a conductivity_table property), and full Field<Tensor> (instead
  of Field<int>).

- InterpolantToTransferMatrix: convert an Interpolant Field (generated by
  BuildInterpolant or FieldBoundary) into its equivalent
  SparseRowMatrix format.  Multiplying resultant matrix by source data
  produces data vector for destination field.

- MaskedLatVolMesh created for iteration through Lattice Volumes
  masked at a cellular level.

- SynchronizeGeometry: (written by Kai Li (University of Oregon)):
  allows for synchronized redrawing of geometry in the Viewer module.
  Useful when generating time-dependent animations, where several
  visualization components (e.g. isosurface, streamlines, color-mapped
  geometry) need to update with each new time-step, and you only want
  one redraw event from the Viewer for all of them.

- Teem/Nrrd support: The following modules have been created in
  the Teem package in order to support storing time dependent or
  multiple sets of data for a given field.  Teem now supports
  conversion of all SCIRun Fields to Nrrds (through dynamic
  compilation).  All Teem modules now support N-dimensional data
  (NRRDS).  All Teem modules now have run-time help information.

  Many Teem user interfaces now update dynamically to reflect the
  N-dimensional NRRDs that may be input. This means that a new net may
  need to execute twice, once to update the GUI and allow correct
  selection of GUI options, and again to send along the correct NRRD.

  - NrrdToField tries to create a Field that is as close as possible
    to the Field type that was originally converted to a Nrrd. If it
    cannot, Scanline, Image, and LatVol Fields are defaults for 1, 2,
    and 3 dimensional NRRDS.

  - NrrdReader now displays all info about the N-axis upon reading a
    NRRD and allows the user to either select which axis should become
    the tuple axis, or choose to add a new tuple axis before sending
    the nrrd downstream.

  - NrrdJoin module added which takes N (NRRD) inputs and joins them
    into a single NrrdData along the user selected axis.

  - Added test networks for all the new/changed Teem modules in
    Teem/nets/tests.

- TransformVectorData module: analogous to the existing
  TransformScalarData module.

- QuadToTri: convert a QuadSurfField into a TriSurfField by
  splitting each quad into two tris.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Module Enhancements
-------------------

- BuildInterpolant and DirectInterpolate: UIs reorganized to better
  reflect the different interpolation options.  We now support
  constant and linear, as well as a special constant interpolation
  method where each source only contributes to a single destination
  (useful for mapping current densities and other quantities that need
  to be conserved).

- BuildFEMatrix (BioPSE): now supports construction of basis matrices.
  One matrix is constructed for each conductivity type.  This allows
  for rapid re-construction of stiffness matrix when only the Field
  conductivities have changed, since the basis matrices can simply be
  scaled and summed.  This feature is enabled via a check-button on
  the UI, and only works for isostropic conductivities.

- ChangeFieldDataType: GUI rewritten to be more user friendly.  The
  data type is now specified independently of the field type, and can
  be saved with networks.

- Centroids: module now works on (ie: dynamically compiles) all mesh
  types.

- FieldBoundary: module was extended to support output of QuadSurf and
  Curve fields when appropriate.

- FieldMeasures: Complete module rewrite to support dynamic input of
  any field type.

- ManageFieldData: Fixed crash bug when field/images sizes where
  mismatched.

- MatrixSelectVector: 

  - Module can now output variable sized arrays of, for example,
    vectors and tensors.

  - Fixed delay bug on the SGI.

- ShowField: Added option for rendering text on fields.  Added support
  for separate color/orientation fields.  The color field is still
  passed into the first port, but now a separate orientation field can
  be passed into the third port for colored arrows, display of
  tensors, etc.

- TetVolField and TriSurfField: Added subdivision of Triangular and
  Tetrahedral fields for local refinement of meshes accessed via
  insert_node(Point) and bisect_element() methods.

- Viewer: 

   - Added an orientation axis (displayed in the upper right corner of
     the Viewer Window.)  It can be turned off by pressing the "+"
     button on the Viewer Window and then pressing the "Orientation"
     toggle button.

   - Fixed Multipass transparency, text overlays, and stickies so that
     they all draw in the correct order.

   - Specify PointSize, LineThickness, and PolygonOffset via Edit
     menu, and save values with net.

   - Specify light directions and colors via Edit menu.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Retired Modules
---------------

- CastField: Replaced by EditField, which was subsequently split into
             three separate modules: ChangeFieldBounds,
             ChangeFieldDataType and ChangeFieldDataAt.

- ChangeCellType: Replaced by HexToTet.

- FDMtoFEM (BioPSE): Also replaced by HexToTet.

- LocateNbrhd: Replaced by BuildInterpolant.

- ManipFields and ManipMatrix: Never actually functional and so removed.

- SampleColorMap and Rescale: Earlier version of what has now become
                              GenStandardColorMaps and RescaleColorMap.

- TetVolFieldCellToNode: Replaced by ChangeFieldDataAt.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Converters
--------------

- Rewrote all conversion applications (in SCIRun/src/StandAlone/convert/).
  New converters have a standardized set of command-line arguments, and
  are comprehensive in providing import and export functionality for all
  Field, Matrix, and ColorMap classes.

- Each converter provides full usage information if invoked with no
  arguments.

- A complete document describing the philosophy and design of these
  converters has been added to the User's Guide.

- We have created example datasets, and documented example
  invocations of the converters; these datasets, along with README
  files are located in the new SCIRunData/convert-examples
  subdirectory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Developer
---------

- Introduce "Tuple" axis on all nrrds loaded into the Teem package.
  The tuple axis is used to store sets of data.  For example a vector,
  and 2 scalar fields.  Therefore all N-dimensional data becomes n+1
  dimension within the Teem package.

- Added a min max widget designed to allow non overlapping range
  selection.

- Implemented clone in NrrdData to support detach.

- The Component Wizard window is now resizeable so that all buttons
  able to be visible on all platforms.

- Reworked configure to be more user friendly.  It is now autoconf
  2.53 compliant.

- Uniprocessor PETSc support via configure option.  New documentation
  on the support and programming of Uniprocessor PETSc within SCIRun.

- Support to allow SCIRun to be run from any directory (assuming the
  'scirun' executable's directory is part of the user's PATH
  environment variable.)

- Thorough implementation of meshes based on mesh concept.

- Added mesh concept method:  bool get_dim(vector<unsigned int> &dims) const;
  Mesh concept is described at: http://software.sci.utah.edu/doc/Developer/CodeViews/html/classSCIRun_1_1MeshConcept.html

- Nicer quit function.  Asks for permission before exiting SCIRun.

- Expanded support for isosurfacing cell centered data.

- Allow probe to work with no input field.  This allows them to be
  computed more quickly if they are used as inputs to other modules
  and the actual probed values are not being used.

- Fixed memory leak of CompileInfo objects.

- Update GeomObj and scene graph objects to use Handles and use less
  memory.

- Renamed Core/Geom/Sticky.* to Core/Geom/GeomSticky.* and
  Core/Geom/Switch.* to Core/Geom/GeomSwitch.*

- Fixed cell locate for LatVolMesh.

- Better interp for HexVolMesh and StructHexVolMesh.

- Fix the (int) conversion for a number of mesh index types.

- Index TriSurfMesh and QuadSurfMesh edges uniquely instead of by
  half-edge.

- Disable display lists.  GeomDL destructor often crashes because
  display_list_ variable is not associated with a context, but is
  global.  Display list per DrawInfoOpenGL item is needed.

- Add RawToStructHexVol converter.

- Preliminary QuadraticLatVolField support.
