    <description>
      <p>The MeshQuality module is used to calculate multiple mesh
quality metrics and report these metrics to the user.  The Sandia
National Laboratories VERDICT library
(http://cubit.sandia.gov/verdict.html) performs the metric
calculations.</p>
      <p>Metric descriptions are taken from VERDICT as follows (descriptions are by element type.)
