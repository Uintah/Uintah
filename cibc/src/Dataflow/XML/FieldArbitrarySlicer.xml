regular field by 1 dimension.

      <p> The Arbitrary Field Slicer input port is a field that has any
topology. The field will be sliced and piped to the output port. </p>

      <p>Read in the utah torso model and display it's boundary for
reference. Then slice the model using the FieldArbitrarySlicer module to
select an arbitrary plane from the torso.</p>

      <title>FieldArbitrarySlicer-testimgi Regression Test</title>

      <p>Create a sample field, populate it with a nice synthetic data
set, and move it to an arbitrary non-identity transformation in space.
Then FieldArbitrarySlicer is used to extract a particular plane or scanline
from the field and the result is visualized for comparison
purposes.</p>
