<p>Gray scale erosion of an image.</p>

<p>Erode an image using grayscale morphology. Erosion takes the minimum of all the pixels identified by the structuring element.</p>

<p>The structuring element is assumed to be composed of binary values (zero or one). Only elements of the structuring element having values &gt; 0 are candidates for affecting the center pixel.</p>
