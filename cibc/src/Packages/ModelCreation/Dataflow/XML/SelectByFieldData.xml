      This module computes a new scalar, vector or tensor array based upon a 
      combination of scalars, vectors, and tensors.

      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>
      This module lets the user compute a new scalar, vector, or tensor array. 
      A scalar array is a nx1 matrix, a vector array is a nx3 matrix, and a 
      tensor array is a nx6 or nx9 matrix (A nx6 tensor is defined as xx, xy, 
      xz, yy, yz, zz). These matrices are used to store scalar, vector or 
      tensor data associated with a mesh or field. To compute new scalar,
      vector or tensor values one has to supply a user-defined function that 
      computes the new values. This function can be either supplied through the 
      GUI or it can be supplied as a string. The module loops through each array 
      element and uses the user-defined function to compute a 
      new value. The output in this case is a function of scalar, vector,
      or tensor arrays. The function is applied by taking the next element of
      each array and applying the function to these variables. When the array
      size of one of the input variables is 1, it is assumed to be a constant
      value and it is taken each time the module gets a value from that array.
      The final size of the array is determined by the size of the other
      input arrays, or by the separate size input port. The latter is supplied 
      in case all inputs are of size one, in which case the module needs a way 
      to determine the size of the output.

      <title>Input elements</title>
      <p>
      There are several input elements available to compute a new scalar values. 
      A short list is displayed below.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      INDEX: The index number, which is the row index. Indexing starts at 0.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      SIZE: The size of the of the new array. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      A,B,C, ...: Matrices representing either scalar, vector, or tensor arrays.
      A scalar array is a nx1 matrix with scalar values, a vector array is a nx3
      matrix and a tensor array is either a nx6 or nx9 matrix. In case of 6
      elements they are stored in the following order: xx,xy,xz,yy,yz, and zz. 
      The number of elements in each array can be either one or the number of 
      scalars in the array. In case only one element is given, it is 
      assumed to be a constant that applies to all data elements. 
      This module allows up to 26 different matrices to be used.

      The output is stored in the variable RESULT.
