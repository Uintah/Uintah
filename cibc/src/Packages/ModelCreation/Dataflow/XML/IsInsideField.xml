      This module determines whether nodes or the centers of the elements
      are located within a volume defined by a volume mesh or by a closed
      surface. If the input field has data on the elements the centers of the
      elements are tested for whethter they are inside the volume. 
      This module assigns a 1.0 to every node or element that is inside the
      object field and 0.0 to every node or element that is outside.
      The module outputs the data both as a field and as a matrix. The latter is
      equal to a selection vector.
