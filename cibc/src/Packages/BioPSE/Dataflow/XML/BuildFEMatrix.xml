      <description>
	<p>
          The "Use Conductivities" box tells the module to look up the
conductivity for each element and to use that information when
constructing the stiffness matrix.  If it is not checked, the module
will use the identity matrix for each element instead (i.e. what was
div(sigma x grad(phi)) turns into div(grad(phi))).  This is useful for
demonstrating the effects of volumetric inhomogeneities on the
electric field. And in practice, it's also a useful debugging tools --
you can immediately see if a solution that isn't converging or is
giving strange results is getting screwed up because of bad
conductivity values or because of something else (e.g. something is
wrong with the mesh).

      <label>Use Conductivity Basis Matrices</label>
      <description>
	<p>
          The "Use Conductivity Basis Matrices" is just an efficiency
option for the case where the user wants to experiment with varying
the conductivity for some of the materials.  Note: it only works with
isotropic materials, and when we have an indexed table of Tensors
(i.e. a Field&lt;int> with a conductivity_table Property, rather than
a Field&lt;Tensor> where each element has a unique Tensor).  This
option will precompute a decomposition of A into:
	</p><p>
          A = sigma_1 x A'_1 + sigma_2 x A'_2 + ... sigma_N x A'_N 
	</p><p>
          where the A'_n matrices are the same size and structure (in
the sparse matrix sense) as A, but just contain contributions from
elements of material type n.  The sigma_n values are just the
isotropic conductivities of the different materials.  If this box is
checked, we build this decomposition.  Then, when a new Field comes
in, the module will check to make sure that only the
conductivity_table has changed, and will regenerate A by adding
together weighted contributions from the basis matrices, A'_n.  In
practice this approach is extremely useful for the parameterized
conductivity search application that's implement in
