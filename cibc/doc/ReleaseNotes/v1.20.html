      Release Notes - SCIRun Version 1.20 - Oct 27, 2003
    </h1>

    <a id="begin-toc">Content:H1,H2</a>

    <h1>
      New Projects in Version 1.20
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Support for the NLM Insight Segmentation and Registration
	Toolkit (www.itk.org)!  Many Insight Filters are wrapped
	with SCIRun modules.  SCIRun infrastructure updated to
	easily allow wrapping of new filters.  See <a
	href="../User/Guide/usersguide/srug8.html">Chapter 8</a> of
	the <a href="../User/Guide/usersguide/index.html">Users Guide</a> on
	how to use ITK Filters. For source distributions, Insight
	must be installed separately.  See the <a
	href="../Installation/Guide/srig.html">Installation
	Guide</a> on how to install Insight.  The RPM distribution
	includes Insight.
      </li>
      <li>
	New stand alone SCIRun Power Apps!  These applications hide the
	complexities of the powerful SCIRun dataflow interface, allowing the
	user to focus on a specific task.  Currently there are two Power
	Apps.  BioTensor and BioFEM.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    BioTensor is used for doing Diffusion Tensor Imaging.
	    This application takes the user from data acquisition,
	    through registration and building diffusion tensors.  In
	    addition, several visualization techniques such as
	    Planes, Isosurfaces, Glyphs and Fibers are provided to
	    allow the user to investigate the data.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    BioFEM is an encapsulation of the forward-fem network
	    that is included in the BioPSE package and described in
	    the BioPSE Tutorial.  With BioFEM, the user can run
	    finite element bioelectric field simulations based on
	    volume conductor models and dipolar sources, and can
	    interactively visualize the simulation results with
	    electric field streamlines and isopotential surfaces.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	Upgraded the Network Editor to be much more user friendly.
	See <a href="#network_editor">Network Editor below</a> (and
	<a href="../User/Guide/usersguide/srug5.html">Chapter 5</a>
	of the <a href="../User/Guide/usersguide/index.html">Users Guide</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
	Full support of OSX (See <a href="../Installation/Guide/srig.html">Installation Guide</a>).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>
      Data Sets
    </h1>
    <ul>

      New Modules
    </h1>

    <h2>
      SCIRun Modules (Category in parentheses)
    </h2> 

    <p>
      The "Choose" modules are used to select one of many input ports
      to pass to the single output port:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	ChooseColorMap (Visualization) 
      </li>
      <li>
	ChooseField (FieldsOther) 
      </li>
      <li>
	ChooseMatrix (Math) 
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
	FieldCage (FieldsOther)&#x2014;Render an rgb 'cage' around the
	incoming field to indicate field bounding box
      </li>
      <li>
	IsoClip (FieldsCreate)&#x2014;Clip a scalar field to a specified
	isovalue.
      </li>
      <li>
	LinearAlgebra (Math)&#x2014;Operations on input matrices to produce new
	output matrices.
      </li>
      <li>
	ManageFieldMesh (FieldsGeometry)&#x2014;Extract and change the
	positions of the nodes in a mesh.
      </li>
      <li>
	MoveElemToNode (FieldsData)&#x2014;Make a new field with data at
	nodes instead of elements.
      </li>
      <li>
	MoveNodeToElem (FieldsData)&#x2014;Make a new field with data
	at elements instead of nodes.
      </li>
      <li>
	SampleStructHex (FieldsCreate)&#x2014;Make a StructHexVolField
	that fits the source field.
      </li>
      <li>
	TransformData (FieldsData)&#x2014;Perform a specified
	functional transform on all of the data in a field.
      </li>
      <li>
	TransformData2 (FieldsData)&#x2014;Perform a specified
	functional transform to each pair of data elements in the two
	input fields.
      </li>
      <li>
	TransformData3 (FieldsData)&#x2014;Perform a specified functional
	transform to each triple of data elements in the three input
	fields.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>
      Teem Modules (Category in parentheses)
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
	ChooseNrrd (Teem - NrrdData)&#x2014;The "Choose" modules are
	used to select one of many input ports to pass to the single
	output port.
      </li>
      <li>
	EditTupleAxis (Teem - NrrdData)&#x2014;Allows user to
	re-organize the entries on the 'tuple' axis, in order to
	group scalars into Vectors/Tensors or vice-versa.
      </li>
      <li>
	TendFiber (Teem - Tend)&#x2014;Fiber tractography (streamlines
	through Tensor fields).
      </li>
      <li>
	TendAnscale&#x2014;Scale the anisotropic component of the
	tensors. This maintains the isotropic component of the
	tensor, and fixes either the trace or determinant, while
	scaling up (or down) the "deviatoric" component of the
	tensor. Good for exaggerating the shape of nearly isotropic
	tensors.
      </li>
      <li>
	TendBmat&#x2014;Calculate B-matrix given gradient directions,
	assuming no diffusion weighting from the other imaging
	gradients. The input is a 3-by-N array of floats or doubles,
	each row being one of the gradient directions used for
	diffusion-weighted imaging. A plain text file with one
	gradient per line, no punctuation, is an easy way to specify
	this information. The gradient vector coefficients are used
	as is, without normalization (since different gradient
	strengths are sometimes desired). The output has one row of
	the B-matrix per line, with coefficient ordering Bxx, Bxy,
	Bxz, Byy, Byz, Bzz, and with the off-diagonal elements NOT
	pre-multiplied by 2.
      </li>
      <li>
	TendEpireg&#x2014;Register diffusion-weighted echo-planar
	images. This registration corrects the shear, scale, and
	translate along the phase encoding direction (assumed to be
	the Y (second) axis of the image) caused by eddy currents
	from the diffusion-encoding gradients with echo-planar
	imaging. The method is based on calculating moments of
	segmented images, where the segmentation is a simple
	procedure based on blurring (optional), thresholding and
	connected component analysis. The registered DWIs are
	resampled with the chosen kernel, with the separate DWIs
	stacked along axis 0.
      </li>
      <li>
	TendEstim&#x2014;Estimate tensors from a set of DW images. The
	various DWI volumes must be stacked along axis 0 (as with
	the output of "tend epireg"). The tensor coefficient
	weightings associated with each of the DWIs, the B-matrix,
	is given as a separate array, see "tend bmat" usage info for
	details. A "confidence" value is computed with the tensor,
	based on a soft thresholding of the sum of all the DWIs,
	according to the threshold and softness parameters.
      </li>
      <li>
	TendEvalClamp&#x2014;Modify shape by clamping eigenvalues in some
	range. The orientation of the tensor is unchanged. Note that
	unlike "tend anscale", this operation can completely change
	the shape of the tensor.
      </li>
      <li>
	TendEvalPow&#x2014;Modify shape by raising eigenvalues to some
	power. The orientation of the tensor is unchanged.
      </li>
      <li>
	TendEval&#x2014;Calculate one or more eigenvalues in a DT volume.
      </li>	  
      <li>
	TendEvecRGB&#x2014;Make an RGB volume from an eigenvector and an
	anisotropy.
      </li>
      <li>
	TendEvec&#x2014;Calculate one or more eigenvectors in a DT volume.
      </li>	  
      <li>
	TendExpand&#x2014;Converts a 7-value DT volume to a 9-value DT
	volume. The 7-value tensor is confidence value followed by
	the unique tensor components (Dxx, Dxy, Dxz, Dyy, Dyz,
	Dzz). The 9-value tensor is the full matrix (Dxx, Dxy, Dxz,
	Dxy, Dyy, Dyz, Dxz, Dyz, Dzz), which is set to all zeros
	when the confidence is below the given threshold.
      </li>
      <li>
	TendMake&#x2014;Create DT volume from confidence and
	eigensystem. The input is in the form of three nrrds, one
	for confidence values (3D), one for eigenvalues (4D, three
	evals per voxel), and one for eigenvectors (4D, nine evec
	components per voxel).
      </li>
      <li>
	TendNorm&#x2014;Normalize tensor size. This operates on the
	eigenvalues of the tensor, and allows normalizing some
	user-defined weighting ("-w") of the eigenvalues by some
	user-defined amount ("-a").
      </li>
      <li>
	TendPoint&#x2014;Describe everything about one sample in a DT volume.
      </li>	  
      <li>
	TendSatin&#x2014;Generate a pretty synthetic DT volume. The
	surface of a sphere or tous is covered with either linear or
	planar anisotropic tensors, or somewhere in between.
      </li>
      <li>
	TendShrink&#x2014;Converts a 9-value DT volume to a 7-value DT
	volume. The confidence value is set to 1.0 everwhere. You
	can "unu splice" or nrrdSplice() something else in its place
	later.
      </li>
      <li>
	UnuAxmerge&#x2014;Merge two adjacent axes into one. A more general
	version of "unu axdelete". The underlying linear ordering of
	the samples is unchanged, and the information about the
	other axes is shifted downwards as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
	UnuAxsplit&#x2014;Split one axis into two axes. More general
	version of "unu axinsert", since a given axis can be split
	into fast and slow axes of arbitrary size, as long as the
	product of the fast and slow sizes is the same as the
	original size.
      </li>
      <li>
	UnuCmedian&#x2014;Cheap histogram-based median/mode
	filtering. Only works on 1, 2, or 3 dimensions. The window
	over which filtering is done is always square, and only a
	simplistic weighting scheme is available. The method is
	cheap because it does the median or mode based on a
	histogram, which enforces a quantization to the number of
	bins in the histogram, which probably means a loss of
	precision for anything except 8-bit data. Also, 8-bit
	integer values can be recovered exactly only when the number
	of bins is exactly min-max+1 (as reported by "Unuminmax").
      </li>
      <li>
	UnudHisto&#x2014;Create (PGM) image of 1-D value histogram
      </li>	  
      <li>
	UnuFlip&#x2014;Reverse order of slices along one axis. Special
	case of "Unushuffle".
      </li>
      <li>
	UnuHisto&#x2014;Create 1-D histogram of values in a nrrd
      </li>	  
      <li>
	UnuPad&#x2014;Pad along each axis to make a bigger nrrd
      </li>
      <li>
	UnuProject&#x2014;Collapse scanlines to scalars along some
	axis. The scanline is reduced to a single scalar by
	"measuring" all the values in the scanline with some
	measure. The output nrrd has dimension one less than input;
	the output type depends on the measure in a non-trivial way,
	or it can be set explicitly with the "-t" option.
      </li>
      <li>
	UnuSlice&#x2014;Slice at a position along an axis. Output nrrd
	dimension is one less than input nrrd dimension. Per-axis
	information is preserved.
      </li>
    </ul>
